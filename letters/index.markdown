To: Scouts of Troop 534 "Hey!"

From: Raymond T. Hightower, Asst Scoutmaster

Subject: How to Request a Letter of Recommendation


### Quick Summary

For Scouts who need a letter of recommendation, I'm glad to write one if you provide:

* Plenty of time. Do not wait until the last minute.
* Clear instructions about where the Letter of Recommendation should be sent.

Also, the request must come from the Scout. Parents must be cc'd (per Youth Protection Guidelines), but the Scout must drive the request.

### How to Make the Request

To request a letter of recommendation:

* Send me an email with the request. If you don't have my email address, speak with the Scoutmaster.
* Be sure to CC one or both parents plus the Scoutmaster. This is required per Youth Protection Guidelines.

### Time Required

Please request the letter at least two weeks in advance of any deadline.

Why this matters: As a Scout, you are a busy person. The same is true for your parents, your teachers, your Scout leaders, and so on. When you make a request, the person writing the letter needs time to write it.


### Providing Key Information

When you make the request, be sure to include information about the person or organization receiving the letter. Key items to list:

* Name of the addressee.
* Title of the addressee.
* Organization name.
* Mailing address and email address of the addressee.
* Background info on the addressee. Typically, a website address (URL) will give the necessary background info.

### Conclusion

If you are in a position to need a Letter of Recommendation, than you are a true achiever. Congratulations on the work you have done so far.

And now I offer you a challenge. Some time in the future, maybe ten or twenty years from now, a young Scout might ask _you_ for a letter of recommendation. I encourage you to give them the same support that you received when you were a Scout.
