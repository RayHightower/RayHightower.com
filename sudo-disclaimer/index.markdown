###You Could Destroy Everything With Sudo

{% include image.html align="right" img="/images/sudo-make-me-a-sandwich.png" caption="Sudo, illustrated by XKCD.com." alt="Sudo, illustrated by XKCD.com." %}

Some of posts on this blog will ask you to use the `sudo` command, available with Linux, Unix, and OS X. Sudo endows users with great power. 

You could destroy all of the data on your computer by using `sudo` incorrectly. Further, since technology changes rapidly, everything you see here could be out of date by the time you read this. Please be careful, back up all of your data, and double-check these steps through your own sources.
