`sudo` is like a sharp knife. Use with care.

Some of posts on this blog will ask you to use the `sudo` command, available with Linux, Unix, and OS X. Sudo endows users with great power. 

You could destroy all of the data on your computer by using `sudo` incorrectly. Further, since technology changes rapidly, everything you see here could be out of date by the time you read this. Please be careful, back up all of your data, and double-check these steps through your own sources.
