`sudo` is like a sharp knife. When used properly, it can make your life
easier.

Some of posts on this blog will ask you to use the `sudo` command, available with Linux, Unix, and OS X. Sudo endows users with great power. 

You could destroy all of the data on your computer by using `sudo` incorrectly. Further, since technology changes rapidly, everything you see here could be out of date (and completely wrong) by the time you read this. Please be careful, back up all of your data, and double-check these steps through your own sources.
