### Early Career

Early in his career, Hightower worked in software development and technical sales in corporate America, follwed by a stint in commercial real estate brokerage with Marcus & Millichap. He studied Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and earned his BS in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

### Launching Companies

Hightower launched WisdomGroup as a network consultancy. He earned the Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE) certification and pulled the company into the Microsoft Certified Solution Provider (MCSP) ecosystem. Later, as the [open source](/blog/2014/02/22/what-is-open-source/) movement gained momentum, Hightower steered the company away from networking and toward software development with open source tools such as [Ruby on Rails](/blog/2017/07/25/a-business-view-of-ruby-on-rails/).

After the pivot to software development, WisdomGroup completed web and mobile projects in multiple industries including healthcare, financial services, high performance computing, e-commerce, travel, event management, and not-for-profit. Each successful project led to larger opportunities and a stronger reputation for the team, culminating in the sale of the company after twenty-one years of operation.
