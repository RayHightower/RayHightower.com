### Early Career

Early in his career, Hightower worked in software development for Hewlett Packard, technical sales for IBM, and commercial real estate for Marcus & Millichap. He studied Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and completed his BS in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

### Launching Companies

Hightower launched WisdomGroup as a network consultancy in 1994. He earned the Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE) certification and pulled the company into the Microsoft Certified Solution Provider (MCSP) ecosystem. Later, as the open source movement gained momentum, Hightower steered the company away from networking and toward software development with open source tools such as [Ruby on Rails](/blog/2017/07/25/a-business-view-of-ruby-on-rails/).

After the pivot to software development, WisdomGroup completed web and mobile projects in multiple industries: healthcare, financial services, high performance computing, e-commerce, travel, event management, and not-for-profit. Each successful project led to larger opportunities and a stronger reputation for the team, culminating in the sale of the company in 2016.

Hightower's latest venture, [Bridgetown Partners](https://bridgetownpartners.com), buys multi-family and mixed-use commercial properties. Bridgetown also builds asset management software for the commercial real estate industry.
