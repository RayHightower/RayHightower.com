Raymond T. Hightower is a tech company founder and commercial real estate investor operating in the State of Arizona, USA. Growing a technology company for twenty-one years and ultimately selling it gave Hightower a boots-on-the-ground education in business execution and vanquishing obstacles. 

Driven by a desire to improve the world through business, Hightower launched [ROIClear](https://ROIClear.com) (formerly [BizDayGlobal](https://BizDayGlobal.com)), the video podcast where business leaders serve others by sharing knowledge. Hightower is active with the Boy Scouts of America where he teaches future leaders about budgeting and time management.

In 2017, Hightower launched [Bridgetown Partners](https://BridgetownPartners.com). Bridgetown is a buyer of commercial real estate in Arizona, Tennessee, and Texas, with a special focus on 50-150 unit multifamily properties.

### Tech Leadership & Speaking

Hightower is the creator of several business and technology media outlets, including [ROIClear](https://ROIClear.com) and [WindyCityRails](/blog/2015/10/05/windycityrails-2015-recap/). He served as lead organizer of [ChicagoRuby](/blog/2017/09/07/passing-the-chicagoruby-baton/) for ten years. He is a perpetual student, currently exploring parallelism, quantum computing, and IoT. Hightower is [invited to speak](/speaking/) at biz/tech conferences around the world, and he blogs on technology and business growth right here at [RayHightower.com](/).

### Early Career

Early in his career, Hightower worked in software development for Hewlett Packard, technical sales for IBM, and commercial real estate for Marcus & Millichap. He studied Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and completed his BS in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

### Launching Companies

Hightower launched WisdomGroup as a network consultancy. He earned the Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE) certification and pulled the company into the Microsoft Certified Solution Provider (MCSP) ecosystem. Later, as the open source movement gained momentum, Hightower steered the company away from networking and toward software development with open source tools such as [Ruby on Rails](/blog/2017/07/25/a-business-view-of-ruby-on-rails/).

After the pivot to software development, WisdomGroup completed web and mobile projects in multiple industries: healthcare, financial services, high performance computing, e-commerce, travel, event management, and not-for-profit. Each successful project led to larger opportunities and a stronger reputation for the team, culminating in the sale of the company after twenty-one years of operation.

Hightower's current focus, [Bridgetown Partners](https://bridgetownpartners.com), is a buyer and syndicator of multi-family properties.
