    <h1 class="post-title">Upgrading Ruby With RVM</h1>
    <p class="post-meta">May 16, 2013</p>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p><a href="http://rvm.io">Ruby Version Manager (RVM)</a> is one of my favorite tools in the Ruby ecosystem.  Reason: RVM lets me experiment with Ruby and Rails at will. I don’t know about you, but my best experiments are full of risk so they eventually blow things up. When that happens, I can always recover the broken areas without wasting time on a full system restore.</p>

<p>Some devs choose to use another tool, <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv">RBenv</a>, that serves a purpose similar to RVM. I began working with RVM before the other tools existed, and since it has always worked well for me, I have no reason to switch.</p>

<h4 id="ruby-200-p195">Ruby 2.0.0-p195</h4>
<p>The latest patch of Ruby 2.0.0, p195, was released two days ago. Time to take it for a spin. RVM lets devs upgrade Ruby and manage gemsets seamlessly. Here’s how the process went.
<!--more--></p>

<h4 id="get-the-latest-rvm">Get the Latest RVM</h4>
<p>Instructions for installing RVM are at <a href="http://rvm.io">http://rvm.io</a>.
If you already have RVM installed, you should confirm that you have the
latest version.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ rvm get head
</code></p>

<h4 id="grab-the-ruby-patch">Grab the Ruby Patch</h4>
<p>With the latest RVM installed, you can upgrade to the latest Ruby
patch level.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ rvm upgrade 2.0.0
Are you sure you wish to upgrade from ruby-2.0.0-p0 to ruby-2.0.0-p195? (Y/n): y
Installing new ruby ruby-2.0.0-p195
Searching for binary rubies, this might take some time.
</code></p>

<p>The process took at least twenty minutes on my system. I don’t have an exact time because I began working on other tasks during the upgrade, and when I looked back at the terminal window, the process was mostly complete, except for a few questions about gemsets…</p>

<p><code>bash
Migrating gems from ruby-2.0.0-p0 to ruby-2.0.0-p195
Are you sure you wish to MOVE gems from ruby-2.0.0-p0 to ruby-2.0.0-p195?
This will overwrite existing gems in ruby-2.0.0-p195 and remove them from ruby-2.0.0-p0 (Y/n): y
Moving gemsets...
</code>
…and aliases, wrappers, and archiving my patchless Ruby 2.0.0.</p>

<p>```bash
Do you wish to move over aliases? (Y/n): y
Do you wish to move over wrappers? (Y/n): y
Do you also wish to completely remove ruby-2.0.0-p0 (inc. archive)? (Y/n): y
Removing ruby-2.0.0-p0……..
Successfully migrated ruby-2.0.0-p0 to ruby-2.0.0-p195
Upgrade complete!</p>

<p>$ 
```</p>

<p>Upgrade complete. Now running the latest patch of Ruby 2.0.0-p195</p>

<p>```bash
~$ rvm list</p>

<p>rvm rubies</p>

<p>macruby-0.12 [ i686 ]
   ruby-1.8.7-p334 [ i686 ]
   ruby-1.9.2-p290 [ x86<em>64 ]
 * ruby-1.9.3-p385 [ x86</em>64 ]
   ruby-2.0.0-p195 [ x86_64 ]</p>

<h1 id="current">=&gt; - current</h1>
<p># =* - current &amp;&amp; default
#  * - default</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>As a final option, I chose to make this latest Ruby patch my default.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<p>~$ rvm use ruby-2.0.0 –default
Using /Users/rth/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p195</p>

<p>~$ rvm list</p>

<p>rvm rubies</p>

<p>macruby-0.12 [ i686 ]
   ruby-1.8.7-p334 [ i686 ]
   ruby-1.9.2-p290 [ x86<em>64 ]
   ruby-1.9.3-p385 [ x86</em>64 ]
=* ruby-2.0.0-p195 [ x86_64 ]</p>

<h1 id="current-1">=&gt; - current</h1>
<p># =* - current &amp;&amp; default
#  * - default</p>

<p>~$ 
```
And that’s it.</p>
