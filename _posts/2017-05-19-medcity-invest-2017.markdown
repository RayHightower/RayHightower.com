>We don't have years, anymore, to make a decision. We have months. Or in some cases, weeks.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>~ Bruce Brandes, CEO of <a href="http://lucro.com/">Lucro</a>

For thousands of years, physicians have created new ways to prevent and cure illness. All of us live better lives because of their work. 

The tradition of improved healthcare continues, even in the face of rapid change. To keep up with the ever-increasing pace, medical professionals are leveraging ideas from other fields. Engineers design diagnostic devices, software developers build apps, and efficiency experts improve workflow in hospitals. As a result, people are living longer, happier lives than ever before.
