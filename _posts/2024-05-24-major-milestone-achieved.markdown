Our team achieved a major milestone this week. Those in the know are aware that we can't share details via social media, yet. But if you have an existing relationship with any member of our team, reach out and we'll talk.

### The Team

Multifamily investing is a team sport. Adrian Diaz, Colby Fryar, and I have learned how to leverage each others' strengths to produce results. I am grateful to work with Colby and Adrian. 

About our team:
* Based in Arizona.
* We've known each other for a few years.
* We began working together closely about a year and a half ago.
* We have vanquished many obstacles together.
* This week, we achieved a major milestone.
* We plan to achieve more milestones through the rest of 2024.

### Helping Communities

We buy multifamily properties, and we improve the properties so we can give people a great place to live. Our buy box:
* 75 units or larger.
* Located in the Phoenix or Tucson MSAs in Arizona.
* Class B or C.
* Opportunity to add value through light renovations.

### Achieving Together

Our track record is strong. If you are a broker or a seller of large multifamily properties, reach out to any member of our team.

And let's achieve milestones together!
