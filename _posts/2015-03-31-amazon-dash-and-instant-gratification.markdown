{% imgcap middle /images/amazon_dash_combo_cc_600.png Amazon Dash innovates by building on existing technologies. %}

The [Amazon Dash Button](https://www.amazon.com/oc/dash-button) is for customers who crave instant gratification. We might think of Dash as a brilliant blend of the Staples Easy Button, WiFi, and Amazon's existing database of credit card numbers.

When a customer runs out of a consumable item, they press a button. The order is sent immediately via WiFi to Amazon, where the customer's credit card number is on file. Delivery can happen within 24 hours, depending on the item. No more standing in line at the store. In fact, no more walking a few feet to a computer to type in an order. Instant gratification, satisfied.

### Video Summary
This 1-minute video explains the service with just a few words, and plenty of images.
