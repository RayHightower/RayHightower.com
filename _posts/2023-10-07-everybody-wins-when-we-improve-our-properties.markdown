greetings this is Ray Hightower speaking to you from Phoenix Arizona currently it's very early on Sunday morning and I'm walking a property one of the first properties that my partners and I bought here in Arizona I'm especially proud of this especially of all the things that I was able to learn from my partners I like to partner with people who know more than me we've made some amazing improvements to this property we've replaced all the electrical panels thereby improving the safety of the property and reducing our insurance expense we have added French drains to the parking lot to improve the draining of the parking lot so water doesn't run up against the building and cause cause of other damage that that water tends to do unless you take preventive measures we've added washers and dryers inside of the units we've replaced the roofs on the buildings we've made so many improvements here and in the end our residents get a great place to live we buy multi-family apartment properties fix them up and give people a great place to live and in the end our investors get Capital preservation tax advantages and a solid return on investment this is Ray Hightower be well
