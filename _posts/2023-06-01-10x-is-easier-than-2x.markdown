_10x Is Easier Than 2x_ is a completely counterintuitive book by Dan Sullivan and Dr Benjamin Hardy, the same duo who penned [Who Not How](/blog/2021/05/29/who-not-how/) and [The Gap and the Gain](/blog/2022/09/29/achieve-more-measure-the-gain/).

### The Gap and the Gain

>When you’re measuring yourself against ideals, it’s like measuring yourself against the moving horizon and then being mad at yourself for not being at the horizon. News flash: You can’t ever reach the horizon.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>From the book 10x Is Easier Than 2x by Sullivan & Hardy

Sullivan and Hardy also wrote [The Gap and the Gain](/blog/2022/09/29/achieve-more-measure-the-gain/), and they reference the earlier book in `10x`.
