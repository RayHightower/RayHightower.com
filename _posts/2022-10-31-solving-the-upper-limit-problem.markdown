### The Upper Limit Problem, Defined

Hendricks has observed that we humans are equipped with an internal "thermostat" that sets an upper limit on our performance. When we achieve more than we believe we deserve, we engage in self-sabotage, thereby pulling our performance back down to the acceptable level set by the thermostat. The thermostat controls our performance. That's the Upper Limit Problem in a nutshell.
