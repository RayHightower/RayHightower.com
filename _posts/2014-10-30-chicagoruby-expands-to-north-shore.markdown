Long-time observers of ChicagoRuby know that the group is always striving to achieve more. Latest move: ChicagoRuby is now hosting a monthly meetup on Chicago’s North Shore. The first meeting of ChicagoRuby: North Shore will be held on Saturday, December 6, 2014 at 10:30am. Visit [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRuby/events/216193202/) for details and to RSVP.

###Why the North Shore?
Why expand to Chicago’s North Shore? One reason: Several ChicagoRuby members live there, and travelling to meetings downtown and in Elmhurst can be quite a haul.

The bigger reason: Two members have stepped up to manage the north shore operation. [Doug Harman](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRuby/members/61690512/) and [Stu Gerstein](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRuby/members/13463131/) have been active in Elmhurst for a long time. They were chosen as organizers because they are vocal and they have already done the preliminary leg work. 

That's how we roll in ChicagoRuby. Many years ago, [Ginny Hendry](https://twitter.com/ginnyhendry) demonstrated that if you push for a new activity in ChicagoRuby (like hack nights) you might end up running it!

###Exciting Year
2014 has proven to be an exciting year for ChicagoRuby. So far, the group has…

* Collaborated with the University of the West Indies at Cave Hill, Barbados to form [LinuxBarbados](http://linuxbarbados.org).
* Built alliances with top-notch developers in multiple countries to create [RubyCaribe](http://rubycaribe.com).
* Expanded the monthly Chicago-area activities to four per month.
* Grown the organizer team to ten (10) members.

Looking forward to more!
