One reason to attend conferences: To discover trends while there's still time to be on the cutting edge. Over 400 trend-spotters gathered in downtown Los Angeles for this weekend's [Intelligent Investors Real Estate Conference](https://www.intelligentinvestors2020.com/). This post offers a snap-shot of the event.

### Summary

IIREC2020 was an amazing collection of investors and service providers, coming together to learn and to teach. Beyond the learning, a few people that I chatted up during the _hallway track_ (see below) shared their approach to problems that real estate investors are uniquely posistioned to attack, such as homelessness. 

Every attendee was exposed to tools that can be used to provide better value for our stakeholders: Investors, residents, tenants, service providers... every stakeholder wins.

### Where are Investors Investing?

Where are investors investing? There are two ways to answer that question: By geography, and by asset class. The IIREC organizers gathered informal data via a wall-sized map and a stack of Post-Its, seen below.

Geographically, IIREC attendees appear to be focused on the coasts. That struck me as strange. My conversations with other real estate investors would lead me to believe that people are moving away from the coasts due to the high cost of entering deals.

What about asset classes? From the chart below, more investors are focused on multi-family than any other asset class. Office deals appear to be less attractive.

### Conclusion




# Out-Takes

### People

The IIREC2020 attendees made me feel most welcome at the event. Each is an owner, operator, investor, banker, service provider, or some combination of the above. Lawyers were on-hand to tell lawyer jokes. Other professions were well-represented, like the physician from central-USA looking to add to his portfolio.

### Business is Good



### Why Attend?

My conference calendar consists mainly of tech-focused events where I’ve built a solid network of contacts over the past few decades. IIREC was interesting because I didn’t know any of the other attendees prior to the conference. Launching [Bridgetown Partners]() has given me an opportunity to add to my professional network. Let the connecting begin!
