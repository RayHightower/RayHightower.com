One reason to attend conferences: To discover trends while we still have time to be on the cutting edge. Over 400 trend-spotters gathered in downtown Los Angeles for this weekend's [Intelligent Investors Real Estate Conference](https://www.intelligentinvestors2020.com/). This post offers a snap-shot of the event.

### Summary

IIREC2020 was an amazing collection of investors and service providers, coming together to learn and to teach. Beyond the learning, a few people that I chatted up during the _hallway track_ (see below) shared their approach to problems that real estate investors are uniquely posistioned to attack, such as homelessness. 

Every attendee was exposed to tools that we can use to deliver better value for our stakeholders: Investors, residents, tenants, service providers... every stakeholder wins.

### Where are Investors Investing?

Where are investors investing? Two ways to answer that question: By geography, and by asset class. The IIREC organizers gathered informal data via a wall-sized map and a stack of Post-Its, seen below.

Geographically, IIREC attendees appear to be focused in the south and on the coasts. The southern trend fits with my intuition, but strong interest in the coasts surprised me. My conversations with other real estate investors have led me to believe that money is moving away from the coasts due to the high cost of entering deals.

Lesson learned: It's important to offset intuition with data.

What about asset classes? From the chart below, more investors are focused on multi-family than any other asset class. Office deals appear to be less attractive.

### Hallway Track

Beyond presentations and panels, much of the learning at IIREC happened in between the scheduled sessions. Conversations with other professionals can encourage us to think about challenges in bold new ways. For example...

* More than one attendee told me about their plans to attack homelessness with manufactured housing. And it's not just about having a place to live. Some owners are providing job training and career counseling on-site.
* Multiple large-scale owners have properties dedicated to former prisoners. Once a person has paid their debt to society, it's helpful for those on the outside to provide means for re-entry into society. Otherwise, recidivism rates soar.
* Properties dedicated to newly emancipated foster youth. What happens to a foster child when they reach the age of eighteen? They're aged out of the system. Humans crave community support. If positive support is not forthcoming, an 18-year-old might fall in with people who are less-than-helpful to society.

In many cases, business leaders can solve problems faster and more effectively than governments. Capitalists can be service-oriented, too!

### Conclusion

My conference calendar consists mainly of tech-focused events where I’ve built a solid network of contacts over the past few decades. IIREC was interesting because I didn’t know any of the other attendees prior to the conference. Launching [Bridgetown Partners](https://BridgetownPartners.com) has given me an opportunity to expand my service to others through my professional network. Let the connecting begin! IIREC2020 is a great launchpad. To the IIREC2020 organizers: Thank you for creating a powerful event!
