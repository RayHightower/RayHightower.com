The [Pine64](http://pine64.org) is a single board computer with four 64-bit cores. The device runs Linux, and prices start at US$15.00.

This guide tells how to get a brand new Pine64 up and running using Mac OS X for image download and creation. Of course, the standard [sudo disclaimer](/sudo-disclaimer/) applies.

### Download the Image File

First, grab the Linux image file that's tailored for the Pine64. As of this writing, the image is [available here](). If that link is outdated, visit [Pine64.org](http://pine64.org) and look for a download link.

Download the image file. It will be archived in `.rar` format.  RAR is used because it has a higher compression ratio than .zip, and `.rar` files can store full file permissions while compressed.

Apple's Mac OS X does not include a utility for de-compressing .rar files. So you will need to grab one.

### Install unrar

[Homebrew](/blog/2014/02/12/homebrew-fundamentals/) is an ideal way to install Unix utilities on Mac OS X. Once you have Homebrew on your Mac, install URar like so:

~~~ bash

~$ brew install unrar
==> Downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/unrar-5.3.11.yosemite.bottl
######################################################################## 100.0%
==> Pouring unrar-5.3.11.yosemite.bottle.tar.gz
üç∫  /usr/local/Cellar/unrar/5.3.11: 5 files, 505.4K

~$ 

~~~

### Testing .rar Archive Health

To confirm that `unrar` is installed correctly and to test the health of your image file...

~~~  bash

$ unrar t arch-pine64-bspkernel-20160304-1-xfce4.rar

UNRAR 5.31 freeware      Copyright (c) 1993-2016 Alexander Roshal

Testing archive arch-pine64-bspkernel-20160304-1-xfce4.rar

Testing     arch-pine64-bspkernel-20160304-1-xfce4.img                OK

All OK

~/Downloads/Pine64$ 

~~~

The message `All OK` means that everything is good with the image and `unrar`.

### Extract the Image File

~~~ bash

The `dd` command takes a _long_ time to run, over 29 minutes on my machine. Here's a quick run-through of the command options:

* `sudo` gives you [super powers](/sudo-disclaimer/). 
* `dd` is the "copy and convert" command. The letters "dd" have nothing to do with what the tool actually does. It's just a command name. And like so many things in computer science, the name might be based on a pun.
* `if=` specifies the input file. You can include the full path, or if the file is in your current directory, you can omit the path as shown in this example.
* `of=` specifies the output file. We know that the SD card is located at `/dev/disk` so that's where the results of this command are headed.  Note that your destination directory may differ from this one.
* `bs=` specifies the block size used for the destination file.

### Checking Progress While `dd` Burns the Image

The `dd` comand does not give any outward sign that it is making
progress. That can be a little uncomfortable because it takes a long
time for the command to run.
Here are two ways to check progress:

* Run the Mac Os X Activity Monitor, and look for a process called `dd`. Watch the `disk writes` number as it increases. You can even sort the processes in descending order by `disk writes`.
* In the terminal window where `dd` is running, hit `control-T` and
you'll see a progress report in the terminal window.

~~~ bash

 
 



~~~



### Once `dd` is Complete

When `dd` is done, it outputs the following:

~~~ bash
~/Downloads/Pine64$ sudo dd if=arch-pine64-bspkernel-20160304-1-xfce4.img of=/dev/disk1 bs=1m
Password:

~~~

From here, you can ejec the SD card from your Mac and insert it the micro-SD card reader on the Pine64. Apply power to the Pine64 and... it boots!


### Comparaing Pine64 vs Parallella

It is natural to compare Pine64 with Parallella. Both are multi-core,
single board computers running Linux. After owning the Pine64 for just a
few hours, here are my first impressions:

* Pine64 feels fast. It boots faster than Parallella and it responds quicker to commands. I'll run benchmarks in coming weeks.

* Parallella comes with more software out-of-the-box. Vim, Emacs, and Git are all present on the Parallella Linux image. Not so with Pine64.

* Pine64 has better hardware connections for power, HDMI, and USB. On the Pine64, all of these connections are standard, full-size. Further, you can connect a keyboard and mouse directly to the two USB ports on the Pine64 without using a USB hub. With Parallella, you need a micro-HDMI adapter, micro-USB adapter, and  USB hub to provide power for operating the keyboard and mouse. 

* Parallella has the clear advantage in number of cores. Each model comes with 2 ARM cores plus 16 or 64 Epiphany RISC cores.

* Pine64 has 4k video. Parallella has 1080p HD video. 

* Pine64 has a version with 2GB of RAM. Maximum RAM on Parallella is 1GB.

* Parallella has a smaller form factor, which may make it more suitable for IoT projects like robots or drones. The Pine64 will require more space inside of any IoT device.

* Pine 64 has the clear advantage when it comes to price. My Pine64 with 2GB RAM was $36.00 including shipping & handling.
