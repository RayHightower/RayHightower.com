[LinuxBarbados](http://linuxbarbados.org) is a user group for open source enthusiasts. The group meets monthly, offering solid knowledge for anyone who wants to ramp up their open source skills. For example, yesterday’s meeting featured a presentation on [XBMC](http://xbmc.org/) by Michael Layne. The presenter dug deep into the tool, offering tips on how to write plugins in C++ or Python.

###Global Reach
The group is based in Barbados on the campus of the [University of the West Indies (UWI) at Cave Hill](http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/). Enthusiasts who don’t live in Barbados can participate _live_ online. So far the group has used Google Hangout for video. Other video solutions will be considered as the group continues to grow.

###Next Steps
Organizers [Maurice Beckles](http://www.meetup.com/LinuxBarbados/members/143194822/) and [Michael Layne](http://www.meetup.com/LinuxBarbados/members/153574612/) have exciting plans for the group. Take a look at the LinuxBarbados calendar, and join [LinuxBarbados](http://linuxbarbados.org) online if you want to hear about future events.

Whether you live in the Caribbean or in Antarctica, we look forward to seeing you!
