[Leap Motion](https://leapmotion.com/) is a small device that lets users control their computers with simple hand gestures. The Leap Motion controller senses individual hand and finger movements. This is not a touch interface, because your hands never touch anything.

### Why Leap Motion?
Computers became easier to use when the mouse grew popular in the 1980s. Touchscreens offer another solution for the interaction riddle. The Leap Motion controller looks like another solution. 

It's still very early for Leap Motion. New applications will be born through this device. Stay tuned!
