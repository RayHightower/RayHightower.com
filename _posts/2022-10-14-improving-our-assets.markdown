### Everyone Wins: Residents, Investors, & Bridgetown

Everyone wins when we make an improvement like this:

* Residents win, because they now have a safer place to live.
* Investors win, because improved safety drives lower insurance premiums. And lower expenses yield higher ROI.
* My partners and I win, because it's always good to make changes that benefit residents and investors.
