### 1990s and the Future Self

In the 1990s, a group of psychologists set out to challenge the prevailing dogma of their colleagues. These psychologists wanted to know, through their own research, what makes a person happy, healthy, and succesful.

The prevailing dogma held that that human happiness was the product of past experiences. Certain levels of past trauma could not be overcome, they believed.  

But the 1990s researchers discovered that human behaviors are not driven by our past experiences. Rather, we are _pulled_ forward by our vision of the future.

### Psych Research + Actionable Steps

The book [Be Your Future Self Now](https://futureself.com/) tells how we might leverage our vision of our future self to achieve bigger goals within a faster timeframe.

The book's author, Dr. Benjamin Hardy, is an organizational psychologist and an expert on the application of Future Self science. Regular readers of this blog will recognize his name. Hardy co-authored (with Dan Sullivan) three books that focus on business excellence: [Who Not How](/blog/2021/05/29/who-not-how/), [10x is Easier than 2x](/blog/2023/06/08/10x-is-easier-than-2x/), and [The Gap and the Gain](/blog/2022/09/29/achieve-more-measure-the-gain/).

### Pulled Forward By Our future?

What does it mean to be pulled forward by our future?

Everything we do is driven by the future we envision for ourselves. When we can clearly see abundance in our future, we will take actions that produce abundance.

However, if our vision of the future is clouded, we are less likely to take productive actions. Even worse, visions of a dismal future can cause us to engage in self-sabotage. 

Fortunately, humans are capable of choosing the future vision that we want for ourselves. We can choose a future of abundance by connecting with our high-achieving future self. Hardy's book tells how.
