[RaiseFest](https://raisefest.com) is _the_ gathering for capital raisers. Capital raising is all about taking capital and matching it with opportunities. 

* People with capital don't necessarily have opportunities for putting their capital to work.
* People with opportunities (entrepreneurs) don't necessarily have the capital to make their opportunities grow. 

That's why capital raising was born: To make the engine of capitalism hum.

And RaiseFest is a major force in the capital raising universe.

### Kick-Off With Hunter Thompson

RaiseFest was created by [Hunter Thompson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hunterlthompson) and the team a [Asym Capital](https://asymcapital.com/). They've raised over $80 million for multiple asset classes: multifamily, mobile home parks, and even ATMs.

The latest installment of RaiseFest was held last week in Phoenix, AZ. Roughly 1,000 capital raisers showed up. The networking alone is worth the price of admission; deals get done between people who know each other.


Key point from Hunter's kick-off presentation: Yes, capital raising is hard right now. And that's why you want to be in the market right now. When things are hard, the less dedicated investors flee, which opens opportunities for those of us who tough-it-out.

To make it through challenging financial times, you gotta have a WHY. Why do you get up in the morning to build your capital raising business? Are you driven by family, childhood circumsances, or something else? Ye must know thyself!
