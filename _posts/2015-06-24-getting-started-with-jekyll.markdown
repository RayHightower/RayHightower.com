[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static HTML generator for web sites that don't require a content management system (CMS). Jekyll sites load quickly, especially when combined with GitHub Pages. [Bobby Reyes](https://twitter.com/bobbyreys) and I will present Jekyll at ChicagoRuby: 1871 on Thursday, June 25, 2015. Slides are below.

### Why Jekyll?
You may already know that RayHightower.com is powered by [Octopress](http://octopress.org) (as of the date of this article). Octopress sits on top of Jekyll. Recently, I discovered that Jekyll offers some advantages that will help this blog greatly, namely:

* A larger community than Octopress. As Linus Torvalds says: With many eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.

* Lots of templates. I am not a designer. Further, since this is a simple blog, an amazing design would be overkill. But the blog must look crisp and professional, right? Jekyll templates that meet my needs are widely available.

### Migration Happening Now
This blog's migration from Octopress to Jekyll is underway. I’ll post when it’s done. In the meantime, take a look at the slides from the Jekyll presentation at ChicagoRuby.

This 82-second video shows how to launch a Jekyll site with the default template.

### Thanks, Octopress!
I am grateful to the Octopress community for introducing me to static page generators. Jekyll is the next logical step for me. And, since technology is always changing, it will be exciting to learn what's next.
