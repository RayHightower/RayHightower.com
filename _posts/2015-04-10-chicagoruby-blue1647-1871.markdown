If you’re a developer itchin’ to ramp up your Ruby skills, Chicago is a great place to be. The local Ruby user group, [ChicagoRuby](http://www.chicagoruby.org), continues to expand in time, space, expertise, and numbers. The group is over 3,200 strong, with six events each month _plus_ the annual [WindyCityRails](http://windycityrails.org) conference. 

The newest locations on ChicagoRuby's monthly list are BLUE1647 and 1871.

### ChicagoRuby: BLUE1647
{% imgcap right /images/blue1647.jpg BLUE1647 %}
[BLUE 1647](http://www.blue1647.com/) is an amazing maker space on Chicago’s South Side, in the Pilsen neighborhood. The leadership of BLUE1647 invited ChicagoRuby to host our first meeting in the space on March 19, 2015. The presenter, [John Contreras](https://twitter.com/johnnycon) of [Matchup](http://matchup.io), took us through the nuances of Rails background processing.

[Rebecca Miller-Webster](https://twitter.com/rmillerwebster) of [thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com) will present at our next BLUE1647 meeting on April 17, 2015.
