>Successful organizations have one common central focus: customers. It doesn’t matter if it’s a business, a professional practice, a hospital, or a government agency, success comes to those and only those who are obsessed with looking after customers.
<br/><br/>~Harvey Mackay, in the Foreword of “Raving Fans"

Ken Blanchard and Sheldon Bowles wrote Raving Fans in the early 1990s, before the internet had captured the attention of the general public. The book makes no mention of web browsers, email, or online stores. And yet the book is not old. The lessons are timeless and useful for any company that wants to compete and thrive in 2020 and beyond.

The book is short, written in story format, and the whole thing can be devoured in a few hours on a weekend. Everything centers around three main lessons:

* Decide what you want.
* Discover what the customer wants.
* Deliver plus one.

### Decide What You Want

So many customer service lessons revolve around the idea that _the customer is always right_. The problem with the _always right_ approach is that a business runs the risk of trying to be all things to all people. 
That's a prescription for burn-out and failure.

Bettter: A company must create a clear vision for what it wants to offer customers, and then offer that clear vision to potential customers. Can the vision shift over time? Yes! And that takes us to the second point.

### Discover What the Customer Wants

The easiest way to discover what the customer wants: Ask them. And listen.
