[PechaKucha](http://pechakucha.org) is a concise presentation style developed in Japan. The PechaKucha format is 20x20: The presenter must share an idea in twenty slides, each displayed for exactly twenty seconds, advancing automatically. Total presentation time = six minutues, forty seconds.

[TableXI](http://www.tablexi.com/blog/2013/06/practice-begins-with-play-a-table-talk/developers/) hosted a PechaKucha on June 13th with the theme _Developer Education_. I was one of six presenters invited to speak. Video:

One highlight from the PechaKucha presentation: This year's [WindyCityRails](http://windycityrails.org) will include a youth program on Thursday afternoon. Details will be announced in July. Follow [@WindyCityRails](http://twitter.com/windycityrails) for the latest news on the program.

Thanks TableXI for the PechaKucha invitation, and for sponsoring WindyCityRails 2013!
