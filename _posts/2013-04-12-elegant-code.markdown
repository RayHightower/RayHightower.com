This quote is too long to tweet, but too good to pass up:

>Ugly programs are like ugly suspension bridges: they're much more liable to collapse than pretty ones, because the way humans (especially engineer-humans) perceive beauty is intimately related to our ability to process and understand complexity. A language that makes it hard to write elegant code makes it hard to write good code.

>~Eric S. Raymond, Author of The Cathedral and the Bazaar
