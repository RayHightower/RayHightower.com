>What is the toughest obstacle you have ever faced in business, and how did you deal with it?<br/>~Student at Trinity High School<br/>&nbsp;River Forest, IL, USA

[Trinity High School](http://www.trinityhs.org/) invited me to speak to two of their student groups this morning. The first, _Information Technology in the Greater Society_ (ITGS), is a project-based class where students explore multiple facets of the information technology industry: Web development, digital editing, open source, and related areas. The second group, _Students Working to Advance Trinityâ€™s Technology_ (SWAT), lives up to its name by ensuring that students and faculty make full use of the technology deployed by the school.

The students I met at Trinity High School are intelligent and ambitious. The "toughest obstacle" question prompted a great deal of thought. My toughest challenge is realizing that WisdomGroup has too many projects for me to know every detail. Therefore, I need to let go and let members of the team handle their areas as expertly as they always do. (The answer sounds good, but this is indeed a struggle, possibly worthy of a blog article.) 

### Getting Started in Software Development
For those students who attended this morning's presentations, here are the links that I promised you:

* [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).  Professional developer tools, offered for free to students.
* [Internet attacks](http://map.ipviking.com/). An animated map showing cyber attacks in real time.
* [w3schools.com](http://www.w3schools.com/). One place to start learning web development.

And here are the slides from the presentation.

### About the Experience
Students at Trinity are attentive and engaged. Their questions enable the learning experience to flow both ways, and the presenter learns as much as the audience. Thank you Trinity High School for a great experience!
