If you own or asset-manage multifamily properties, you know that it takes a long time to review a monthly financial statement. 

Rather, it takes a long time to review it thoroughly & WELL. 

Therefore, I'm experimenting with AI (specifically, Grok by xAI) as a tool for streamlining this task. 

### Prompting Grok

Here's one of the Grok prompts I'm testing: 

<!--more-->

~~~ bash

Act as a multifamily asset manager, and review the attached financials (uploaded as an Excel file). 

* What discrepancies do you see? What potential issues do you see? 

* Where is the property performing well? Where is the property performing poorly? 

* What steps would you recommend for improvement? 

* What additional questions should I be asking you?

### Grok's Response

Grok comes back with a 4-page report with lots of questions. 

And now we're having deeper and more substantive conversations with our on-site management team.
