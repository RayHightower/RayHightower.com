### More Details on Parallella

Summarizing Parallella in a 5-minute lightning talk presented a challenge. I had to skip some details. If your appetite has been stimulated and you'd like to know more, here are some resources for you:

* 25-minute video from [Madison+ Ruby](http://rayhightower.com/blog/2015/08/22/madison-ruby-and-parallella/) in August 2015. Also answers why WisdomGroup experiments with Parallella.

* [Parallella Quick Start Guide](/blog/2014/07/07/parallella-quick-start-guide-with-gotchas/). One of many "getting started" guides.

* [Solar Powered Parallella](/blog/2014/09/09/solar-powered-parallella/). Details on how to rig a USB/power cable and hand-held solar panel to power Parallella.

* Official [Parallella Site](http://parallella.org/). Great forum discussions.

Doing something interesting with Parallella? Feel free to [dash me a message](/contact). If there's a good fit, you might be invited to present at [ChicagoRuby](http://chicagoruby.org)!
