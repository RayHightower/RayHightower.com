Node-RED is a visual wiring tool for the Internet of Things. What does that mean, and why do we care?

When you‚Äôre building a project using physical components (atoms) instead of software (bits), physical constraints come into play. For example: Is that jumper cable long enough to connect the two contacts that need connecting? Or is it too long, requiring you to wrap the excess somewhere?

I chose ‚Äúdeny‚Äù because I‚Äôm only running Node-RED locally on my machine. YMMV.
