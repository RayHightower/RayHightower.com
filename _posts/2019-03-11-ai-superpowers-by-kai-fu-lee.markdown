Machines powered by artifical intelligence have excelled at games for decades. IBM’s Big Blue defeated chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1996. Alphabet's AlphaGo defeated a champion Go player, Lee Sedol, in 2015.

Game-focused AI is highly specialized and mostly ineffective in in other areas. What about general purpose AI, software that can mimic human intelligence and make human-like decisions? What about applications beyond games?

Dr. Kai-Fu Lee examines these questions in his book, [AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order](https://aisuperpowers.com). Lee draws on his background as a pioneering AI researcher and successful entrepreneur to explain why certain subsets of AI produce results, and how readers of the book might benefit.

### Rules, Neural Nets, and Deep Learning

In their quest to mimic human intelligence, AI researchers in the 1980s pursued two primary paths.

* **Rules-based systems**. Long chains of `if-then-else` statements. In order to build a rules-based system, the developer must have access to subject matter experts who know the problem domain well. And then they must work arduously to predict every possible stimulus and response. Broad, unpredictable domains are more difficult to handle this way.
* **Neural networks**. Rather than try to think of every possible scenario in advance, the developer exposes the neural net to a wide variety of scenarios that force the system to "learn" the desired behavior over time. For example, when teaching a neural net to recognize a picture of a cat, the developer might shows the system a large number of cat pictures (labeled "cat") and a large number of pictures without cats (labeled "not-cat"). Over time, the neural net grows stronger in its predictive ability.

Neural networks fell out of favor in the 1990s because computer hardware was not powerful enough to make them work well. However, the technology has recently re-emerged under a new moniker, _deep learning networks_.

### Focus on Deep Learning

Lee believes that deep learning is the subset of AI likely to bear the most fruit in the next few years. Deep learning will also wreak the most havoc. Human jobs that depend on pattern recognition, and jobs where rapid repition is an advantage, are likely to be replaced by deep learning tools. For example:

* **Driving**. When Lee was in graduate school, it was believed that we would call computers "intelligent" if they could drive a car. Today, AI researchers have determined that driving is largely a pattern recognition and response problem. Now that computer vision systems are powerful enough to recognize and respond to patterns correctly, self-driving cars are here, today.
* **Law**. As recently as a few decades ago, a new lawyer working on a large legal team might be assigned the task of discovery, the process of sifting through mountains of paper documents looking for strings of words relevant to the case. This pattern recognition problem is better handled by deep learning system that "reads" flawlessly and never gets tired. Instead of "killing all the lawyers," as Shakespeare would have it, we might replace most of them with AI.
* **Medicine**. Physicians who practice radiology spend years in medical school developing their skills. The experienced eyes of a radiologist can tell the difference between a life-threatening growth and something benign. Of course, this is another example of a pattern recognition problem. A computer vision algorighm that can accurately identify faces in a crowd can also scan x-ray images for health issues. Further, the algorithm can draw on a database containing medical knowledge from around the planet in an instant. And the algorithm never gets tired.

Bottom line: Deep learning will eliminate (or drastically alter) many professions that were once considered safe from AI.

### GPU Acceleration

Graphics processing units (GPUs) are specialized processors which were originally designed to perform the calculations necessary for advanced graphics.

### Jobs Less Likely to be Replaced by AI

Jobs that require human creativity and human compassion, two things that AI cannot do.

### About the Kai-Fu Lee

For deeper insight into _AI Superpowers_, it might be helpful to know more about the author.

Dr. Kai-Fu Lee is a PhD computer scientist and founder of Sinovation Ventures, a $2 billion technology investment firm with offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Seattle, and Silicon Valley. Prior to launching Sinovation Ventures, Lee served as Google’s highest ranking executive in China. Lee’s resume includes engineering and leadership positions at Microsoft, Silicon Graphics, and Apple.

Lee was born in China. He was sent to the USA at the age of eleven because his mother wanted him to be educated beyond the rote memorization curriculum that was locally available. Lee’s mother required him to write to her weekly in Chinese

General purpose AI that mimics human intelligence continues to elude researchers. Fortunately, one subset of AI, deep learning, is already delivering results in professions that were once considered beyond automation. Deep learning will quickly engulf us, eliminating many of our so-called "safe" professions as early as 2030. So says Dr. Kai-Fu Lee, author of the book
