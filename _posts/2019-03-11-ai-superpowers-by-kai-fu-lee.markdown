Machines powered by artifical intelligence have excelled at games for decades. IBM’s Big Blue defeated chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1996. Alphabet's AlphaGo defeated world champion Go player, Ke Jie, in 2017.

Game-focused AI is highly specialized and mostly ineffective in in other areas. What about general purpose AI, software that can mimic human intelligence and make human-like decisions? What about applications beyond games?

Dr. Kai-Fu Lee examines these questions in his book, [AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order](https://aisuperpowers.com). Lee draws on his background as a pioneering AI researcher and successful entrepreneur to explain why certain subsets of AI produce results, and how readers of the book might benefit.

### Rules, Neural Nets, and Deep Learning

In their quest to mimic human intelligence, AI researchers in the 1980s pursued two main paths.

* **Rules-based systems**. Long chains of `if-then-else` conditions. In order to build a rules-based system, the developer must have access to subject matter experts with intimate knowledge of the problem domain. And then they must work arduously to predict every possible stimulus and response. Broad, unpredictable domains are more difficult to handle this way.

* **Neural networks**. Rather than try to think of every possible scenario in advance, the developer exposes the neural net to a wide variety of scenarios that force the system to "learn" the desired behavior over time. For example, when teaching a neural net to recognize a picture of a cat, the developer might show the system a large number of cat pictures (labeled "cat") and a large number of pictures without cats (labeled "not-cat"). After enough iterations, the neural net learns how to classify the photos correctly.

Neural networks fell out of favor in the 1990s because computer hardware was not powerful enough to make them work well. However, the technology has recently re-emerged under a new moniker, _deep learning networks_.

The most advanced deep learning networks learn from each other. For example, AlphaGo Zero, the latest version of the system that beat the world's best Go player, learned to play the game by competing against other instances of itself. As with humans, the toughtest competitors emerge from the fiercest battles.

### Deep Learning Re-Emerges

Of all the AI subsets, Lee believes that deep learning will generate the largest ROI in the next few years. His belief is based on decades of experience and these observations: Our computers are powerful enough and our algorothms are good enough.

Further, advancements in computer vision and speech recognition have given us new ways to communicate with our machines. Cameras are cheap and ubiquitous. Speech recognition is so inexpensive and so good that Amazon/Google can give it away for (almost) free and turn a profit when customers buy goods through the voice interfaces.

### Deel Learning and Human Careers

Deep learning will also wreak havoc with careers. Human jobs that require pattern recognition will be replaced by deep learning tools. For example:

* **Driving**. When Lee was in graduate school, most researchers believed that we would call a computer "intelligent" if it could drive a car. Over time, our scientists reframed the car driving problem as a challenge involving pattern recognition followed by appropriate responses. And while better algorithms were being developed, the price:performance ratio of computer hardware continued to improve thanks to Moore's law. Today we have self-driving cars and we recognize that they're not truly intelligent. Our self-driving vehicles are leveraging advanced mathematics masquerading as intelligence.

* **Law**. As recently as a few decades ago, a new lawyer working on a large legal team might be assigned the task of discovery, sifting through mountains of paper documents looking for strings of words relevant to the case. This pattern recognition problem is better handled by a deep learning system that reads flawlessly without getting tired. A character from Shakespeare advised his companions to "kill all the lawyers." Deep learning would be a happier alternative for most members of the bar.

* **Medicine**. Physicians who practice radiology spend years in medical school developing their skills. The experienced eyes of a radiologist can tell the difference between a life-threatening growth and something benign. Of course, this is another example of a pattern recognition problem. A computer vision algorighm that can accurately identify faces in a crowd can also scan x-ray images for health issues. Further, the algorithm can draw on every piece of medical information stored in any shared database on the planet, in an instant. And the algorithm never gets tired.

Bottom line: Deep learning will eliminate (or drastically alter) many professions that were once considered safe from any sort of mechanical automation. Lee predicts that 40% of jobs worldwide will be displacable by deep learning and related technologies by 2039.

### Deep Learning in China

As the founder of a VC firm operating in China, Lee offers some interesting thoughts about how the companies will thrive in an era of deep learning.

First, deep learning depends on two key resources: Processing power and large amounts of data. The processing power is here, today. Data can be tough to come by sometimes, especially in the United States and other Western countries.

But in China, the data required to train deep learning algorithms is plentiful and largely untethered by privacy laws. Algorithms designed to learn from Chinese data have an advantage. Lee shares examples of companies, based in China, that were once considered immitators of their US-counterparts. But in many cases, the Chinese company has grown larger than the company it formerly emulated, thanks to deep learning and a huge mountain of data.


### People Displaced by Deep Learning? What's Next?

Some people will argue that we've been through changes like this before. Whenever humans develope new, labor-saving technology, 





### Jobs Less Likely to be Replaced by AI

Jobs that require human creativity and human compassion, two things that AI cannot do.

### About Kai-Fu Lee

For deeper insight into _AI Superpowers_, it might be helpful to know more about the author.

[Dr. Kai-Fu Lee](https://twitter.com/kaifulee) is a PhD computer scientist and founder of [Sinovation Ventures](http://www.sinovationventures.com/), a $2 billion technology investment firm with offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Seattle, and Silicon Valley.

Lee was born in China. He was sent to the USA at the age of eleven because his mother wanted him to be educated beyond the rote memorization curriculum that was available in the town of his birth. To maintain his Chinese writing skills, Lee’s mother required him to write to her weekly in Chinese. And she would return each of his letters to him with corrections. Motherly encouragement paid off. Today, Lee is fluent in Chinese and English and he flows easily between the cultures.

Lee holds degrees in Computer Science from Columbia University (A.B.) and Carnegie Mellon (PhD). He pioneered speech recognition research at Apple. Later, he served in technical leadership positions at SGI, Microsoft, and Google. He left Google as the highest ranking Google exec in China, and founded Sinovation Ventures, a VC firm that focuses on AI.

Prior to launching Sinovation Ventures, Lee served as Google’s highest ranking executive in China. Lee’s resume includes engineering and leadership positions at Microsoft, Silicon Graphics, and Apple.

General purpose AI that mimics human intelligence continues to elude researchers. Fortunately, one subset of AI, deep learning, is already delivering results in professions that were once considered beyond automation. Deep learning will quickly engulf us, eliminating many of our so-called "safe" professions as early as 2030. So says Dr. Kai-Fu Lee, author of the book 

### GPU Acceleration

Graphics processing units (GPUs) are specialized processors which were originally designed to perform the calculations necessary for advanced graphics.
