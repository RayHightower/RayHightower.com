Rooftop due diligence. Yes, it is important for us to inspect the roof of any asset that we're buying. Even more important: We need to bring multiple experts on the journey with us. Experts who know exactly what they're looking at.

Why experts, plural? Here's why.

During a recent roof inspection, we were fortunate to have a multiple experts on-hand, each operating from a different viewpoint. 

* Some experts always recommend replacement because they're in the business of replacing roofs. 

* Other experts give solid maintenance tips because they're in the business of building relationships. 

It is important to know what kind of expert we're dealing with up front. And to make decisions accordingly.
