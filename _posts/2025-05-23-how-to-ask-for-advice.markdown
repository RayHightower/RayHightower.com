Want the best advice? Here's how to get it. (sources cited below):

1. Ask only credible people (Ray Dalio: "have done the thing successfully, multiple times, and can articulate how")
2. Consider their incentives (don't ask a barber whether you need a haircut)
<!--more-->
3. Ask for frameworks, not answers (never delegate your thinking)
4. Make sure you fully understand the advice — ask for examples, repeat the advice back and ask if you got it right
5. Backtest the advice: think of times you could have followed it, think of what would have happened
6. Once you've accepted the advice, take immediate steps to implement it! Surprising how often folks (including me) skip this step — no point in receiving good advice and doing nothing with it
