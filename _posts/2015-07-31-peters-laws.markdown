Walking through Chicago’s [Museum of Science and Industry](http://msichicago.org), I ran across an inspiring list of rules titled "Peter’s Laws". Peter Diamandis is Chairman and CEO of the X PRIZE Foundation, best known for its $10 million Ansari X PRIZE for private spaceflight. 

The Laws:

<ol start="1">
<li>If anything can go wrong, Fix It!  (To hell with Murphy!)</li>
</ol>

<!--more-->

<ol start="2">
<li>When given a choice-Take Both!</li><br/>
<li>Multiple projects lead to multiple successes.</li><br/>
<li>Start at the top then work your way up.</li><br/>
<li>Do it by the book....but be the author!</li><br/>
<li>When forced to compromise, ask for more.</li><br/>
<li>If you can't beat them, join them, then beat them.</li><br/>
<li>If it's worth doing, it's got to be done right now.</li><br/>
<li>If you can't win, change the rules.</li><br/>
<li>If you can't change the rules, then ignore them.</li><br/>
<li>Perfection is not optional.</li><br/>
<li>When faced without a challenge, make one.</li><br/>
<li>"No" simply means begin again at one level higher.</li><br/>
<li>Don't walk when you can run.</li><br/>
<li>Bureaucracy is a challenge to be conquered with a righteous attitude, a tolerance for stupidity, and a bulldozer when necessary.</li><br/>
<li>When in doubt: THINK!</li><br/>
<li>Patience is a virtue, but persistence to the point of success is a blessing.</li><br/>
<li>The squeaky wheel gets replaced.</li><br/>
<li>The faster you move, the slower time passes, the longer you live.</li><br/>
</ol>

True, some of the "Laws" are over-the-top! My favorite from the list: #1. An excellent way to deal with obstacles.
