All of us are inspired when we have a big goal to achieve. Antoine De Saint-Exupery expresses the idea well:

>If you want to build a ship, donâ€™t drum up the people to gather wood, divide the work and give orders. Instead, encourage them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.

2013 is already proving to be an exciting year. Looking forward to more.
