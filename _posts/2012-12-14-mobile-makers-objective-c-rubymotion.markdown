This week I enrolled in the iOS Accelerated course offered by the [Mobile Makers Academy](http://mobilemakers.co/ios-accelerated). If you would like to do the same, mention my name and we'll both receive a $300 discount on tuition.

Class starts on Jan 7, 2013. The evening lectures are convenient for those who serve clients by day.

Of course, a tuition discount and easy schedule are poor reasons to enroll in a course. This article will describe my reasons for enrolling. If your thirst for learning is anything like mine, you might like Mobile Makers too.

### Background and Expectations
My background includes an undergrad degree in computer science. Over the years, I've coded in C, Lisp, Fortran, Pascal, x86 assembler, and Ruby. I became a "business guy" when I launched WisdomGroup eighteen years ago. WisdomGroup is fortunate to have a team of strong technologists who keep our clients happy while teaching me more every day. 

In late 2011, I began to focus on sharpening my personal technical skills, and that led to my immersion in [RubyMotion](/blog/2012/10/29/building-ios-apps-with-ruby-motion/) this year. I expect the Mobile Makers experience to strengthen my grasp of Objective-C, OO theory, and iOS. Cross-training with Objective-C will boost my RubyMotion skills as well. 

### Instruction Format
[Don Bora](https://twitter.com/dbora) is the head instructor at Mobile Makers. Don is embarrassed when I say this, but he's the main reason why I chose to enroll. Don is a true polyglot programmer, with a background that includes Objective-C (of course!), C#, Java, Ruby, and Smalltalk among other languages. He currently builds Objective-C apps for his clients at [Eight Bit Studios](http://eightbitstudios.com/). Don holds degrees in computer science and linguistics. 

Mobile Makers offers a learning format that is relatively new to me. Beyond the traditional classroom lectures, students get plenty of time for lab immersion and interaction with mentors. I first witnessed this format when Neal Sales-Griffin and Mike McGee launched [The Starter League](http://starterleague.com). 

### More About Lab Time and Mentorship
Classroom sessions are fine, but they're not enough. Can you learn a musical instrument by listening to lectures and taking notes? Mastering a skill like software development requires deliberate practice with challenging exercises. Learning is accelerated when lectures, labs, and mentorship complement each other. 

### Learning Architecture
Behind the scenes, Adam Lupu is the learning architect who designed the Mobile Makers curriculum. In Don's words: "I know how to explain things, but I don't know how to structure a course. That's where Adam comes in." Adam was the lead architect behind the Rails-based curriculum at the Starter League. Now he's building the mobile curriculum at Mobile Makers.

### Excitement
The Mobile Makers [iOS Accelerated](http://mobilemakers.co/ios-accelerated) class is only three weeks away. If you mention this blog post, you and I will both get a $300 tuition discount. More important, we will acquire skills that will serve us well as we solve problems for clients. What an exciting time to be a developer!
