When we experiment with something new, it's helpful to look for a _quick win_. Achieving a quick can be like a jolt of encouragement to keep us going when we encounter the roadblocks that everyone encounters when they try something new.

The purpose of this post is to give you a quick win with the Raspberry
Pi Model 3. 

This post will show you how to:
* Download and install an operating system for your Raspberry Pi.
* Use SSH to control your Pi from a laptop, so you won't need an external monitor.
* Use VNC so that you can use your Piâ€™s GUI with without carrying a separate monitor.

### Out Takes
The Raspberry Pi remains at the top of the heap of single-board computers. Other single-board computers may have more cores or more power or a lower price. But the Pi remains on top largely due to the community of support that surrounds the device.
