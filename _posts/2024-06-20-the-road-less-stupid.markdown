>Smart people do dumb things. Here's the proof: How much money would you have right now if I gave you the ability to undwind any three financial decisions you have ever made? Write that number down... seriously.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>– Keith Cunningham, Author<br/>The Road Less Stupid

Kudos to the author of _The Road Less Stupid_ for the irreverant way that he launches chapter one. The title of the book is indimidating. After all, how many of us what to read a book that highlights our mistakes?

Fortunately, the author takes an unorthodox path. Rather than saying "Hey dummy, look what you did", he says "hey... we're both dummies. Now here's what we can do to become less dumb."

Those who give advice are more effective when they can admit their own flaws. Extra points for blending in a twist of humor!

### Get the Audio Version

Special thanks to [Catherine Bell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherinebell-tig/) for recommending this book to me. Catherine suggested that I get the audio version because the author's points are best communicated with his persoinal tone-of-voice and inflection. And I pass that recommendation along to you!

### About the Author

The author's background is especially relevant in this case because he claims to know how a business owner might make smarter decisions. Naturally, the reader would be inclined to ask "who are you and why should I listen to you?"

In the late 1980s, Keith Cunningham was wiped out in the collapse of the real estate market in the Southwestern USA. Prior to that time, Keith and his associates considered themselves geniuses because of the millions they earned just before the downturn. After the bust, they had zero cash, negative cash flow, and the level of their debt was greater than the market value of their assets.

Keith summarizes the experience on one of his metaphorical bumper stickers. 

>The best time to learn the lessons (and avoid the dreaded dumb tax) is prior to making the mistake in the first place.

Pain is a powerful teacher. A whipping like that will cause you to steer clear of such lessons in the future.

### How the Book Fits Together








>It is not supposed to be easy. Anyone who finds it easy is stupid.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>– Charlie Munger, Investor



### Patience

>It takes character to sit there with all that cash and do nothing. I didn't get to where I am by going after mediocre opportunities.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>– Charlie Munger


### Gathering Data

>Pilots of high performance machines do not fly by the seat of their pants.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>– Keith Cunningham, ch27

Running a business by the seat of your pants can be exciting, but it is not sustainable. 

Making sure you survive versus maximizing return on investment on a given investment.
(Keith Cunningham has better words for this. Use Keith‘s words.)
