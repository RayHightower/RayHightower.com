Why it is important to have a sense of urgency in business? 
What steps are YOU taking to maintain a sense of urgency in your life?

Recently, I had the opportunity to respond to something with an investor, and I could have waited to respond. But I decided to move with urgency instead.

I dropped what I was doing. I responded to that investor's questions immediately. 

They shot back to me immediately after that. And we were able to consummate a relationship, all because of a sense of urgency. 

URGENCY and MOMENTUM
When we have a business idea, we are more likely to achieve a favorable result when we move forward with urgency. 

Executing with a sense of urgency builds momentum, and we increase the odds of a successful result. 

HARD to ADMIT
Something that's hard for me to admit: I keep learning this lesson over and over again. I learned the urgency lesson years ago, back when I was running my technology company. I've re-learned the urgency lesson in multiple real estate deals. I keep needing to learn this lesson repeatedly. 

I'm sure that you're not as stubborn as me :-)

TO MY FUTURE SELF
So, I'm recording this video as a form of encouragement to my future self. I must strive for a sense of urgency, especially when it comes to business. Especially when it comes to responding to a client request, whether that client's request is overt or implied. 

HOW ABOUT YOU?
