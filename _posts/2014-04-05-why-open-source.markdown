As members of the open source community, we have internalized the benefits of open source. Sometimes, knowing a topic so well can hinder us from explaining it to people who need to understand our work: Clients, customers, and employers. They need to understand us because they pay us. Understanding helps to build trust.

The topic [What is Open Source](/blog/2014/02/22/what-is-open-source/) is covered in earlier post by that title. This presentation covers some of the "whys" of open source in terms that matter to the people we serve: Clients, customers, and employers.

This presentation was delivered at the [Flourish 2014](http://flourishconf.com/) conference at the University of Illinois at Chicago. I am grateful to the Flourish organizers and to UIC for inviting me to speak.
