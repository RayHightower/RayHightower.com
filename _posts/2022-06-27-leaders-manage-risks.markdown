A few years ago, I was invited to speak to a group of entrepreneurs about my business war stories. My background includes decades as founder/president/CEO of companies in technology and real estate. Most of the questions from the audience focused on those areas.

At one point an audience member asked, "How do you respond to people who consider entrepreneurship to be risky?"

"It _is_ risky," I responded. And then I shared a story about pot holes, and steering wheels.

### Pot Holes and Steering Wheels

Being an entrepreneur is a lot like driving a car down a street covered with pot holes. Most people who see the street covered with pot holes simply throw up their hands and exclaim "oh no, pot holes!" And they avoid the street altogether.

But something in the entrepreneurial DNA causes us to dig further. "Yes, the street has pot holes," observes the entrepreneur. "But I happen to know that there's gold at the end of that street. If I can figure out a way to navigate the street in spite of the pot holes, I can get the gold."

The entrepreneur recalls that the car is equipped with a steering wheel. Sitting in the drivers seat, the entrepreneur turns the wheel to avoid the pot holes, navigates the street, and obstains the gold.

### Yes, It's Risky

True, the above story will never compete against the fables of Aesop! But it makes the point. As business leaders, our job is to manage risk. When everyone around us throws up their hands in fear, our job is to gather data, create a plan, and execute the plan to completion.  Yes, it's risky. And our job is to manage risks so that we can achieve our goals. 

Since successful entrepreneurs rarely work alone, everyone on the team wins when entrepreneurs achieve goals.

Congratus and _well done_ to all the entrepreneurs who manage risks!
