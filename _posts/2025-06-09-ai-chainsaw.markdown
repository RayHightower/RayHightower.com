### Artificial Intelligence with Catherine Bell

[Catherine Bell]() consistently gives spell-binding accounts of her experiments with AI. Earlier this year during RaiseFest, she kicked off her AI presentation with a metaphor about an axe.

* If you’re a lumberjack and you spend years chopping trees with an axe, you’ll eventually get good at it.
* What if someone hands you a chainsaw, and tells you to use that new device instead?
* If you’ve never seen a chainsaw before, you might try swinging it at a tree (as you did with the axe). That doesn’t work.
* Better way to move forward: Learn how to use the chainsaw, including cleaning, fueling, and regular maintenance.

In summary: AI is a chainsaw in a world of axes. Learn to use the chainsaw.
