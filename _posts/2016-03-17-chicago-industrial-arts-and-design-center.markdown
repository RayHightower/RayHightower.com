>Don't just be stuck with an idea in your head. Build it, and get it in your hands.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>~Alan Baker of Chicago Industrial Arts & Design Center

The [Chicago Chapter](http://www.meetup.com/acm-chicago/events/229049466/) of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) hosted a special meeting at the Chicago Industiral Arts & Design Center ([CIADC](http://www.ciadc.org/)) on Wednesday evening. It's tempting to call CIADC a maker space because it certainly appeals to makers. But as the ACM group learned on Wednesday, CIADC stretches beyond making and into empowerment.

### Makers and Computers

Why would ACM Chicago choose to tour a maker space? Two key reasons:

* Computing touches everything. As Mark Andreesen phrased it, [software
is eating the world](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=marc%20andreessen%20software%20eating%20the%20world)

* Making things has almost become a lost art, especially in the USA.  People who can make things are in demand because many of us have failed to learn how.
