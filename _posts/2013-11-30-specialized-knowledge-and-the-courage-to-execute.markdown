Teenagers are a tough audience. If you have ever spoken to a youth group, you know the challenge: Speak about something important without putting the youth to sleep. Tall order.

###Three Stories
Boy Scout [Troop 534 "Hey!"](http://troop534.org) asked me to speak at the Troop’s annual reunion breakfast this year.  I approached them with three stories centered around the theme of _Specialized Knowledge and the Courage to Execute_. What a boring title! But the three stories appealed to the group. Here’s a summary of the first story:

>A tractor maker takes drastic action when when Enzo Ferrari (creator of the Ferrari sports car) pisses him off.

###Gratitude
This event was a big deal for me because I grew up in Troop 534 "Hey!", I currently serve as one of the adult leaders, and the breakfast organizers normally invite an outsider to speak. Why listen to a speaker who you see all the time?

I took the speaking invitation as an opportunity to assemble some new material. Thank you scouts, parents, and leaders for having me.
