[Hashrocket](http://hashrocket.com) launched Ancient City Ruby in 2013 and the conference has grown ever since. Participants come from around the world; some to speak, some to learn, some to pair-program with the Hashrocket team for days (or weeks) after the conference.
 
I am grateful to the organizers for inviting me to present _Get Started With Parallel Programming Featuring Parallella_ this year.
