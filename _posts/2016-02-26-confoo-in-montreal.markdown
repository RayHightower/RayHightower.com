[ConFoo](http://confoo.ca) is a nine-track conference for web developers, held every year in Montreal, Canada. Multiple languages and framework are represented: Python, .Net, Ruby, C#, JavaScript... the works. ConFoo also offers a healthy helping of IoT including Arduino and Raspberry Pi. This year, the organizers invited yours truly to present [Parallella](/blog/2014/07/07/parallella-quick-start-guide-with-gotchas/). Thanks organizers!
