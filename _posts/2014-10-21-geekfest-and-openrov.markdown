[Geekfest](http://www.meetup.com/Geekfest/events/207936312/) is a weekly event hosted by Groupon's engineering team. Every Tuesday at lunchtime, the company invites members of the tech community to present topics that are interesting to a technical audience. 

I wish to express my thanks to Groupon for inviting me to present [OpenROV](/blog/2014/06/16/citizen-science-with-openrov/) at today's Geekfest.
