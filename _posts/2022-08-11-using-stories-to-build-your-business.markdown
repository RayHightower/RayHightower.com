>Your customer should be the hero of the story, not your brand. This is the secret every phenomenally successful business understands.<br/><br/>~Donald Miller, Author 

We humans remember stories at a greater level of detail than we could ever recall a ten-bullet list from a powerpoint presentation. The most successful companies use stories when wooing customers.

Now... What kinds of stories are most effective?

### SB7 Framework

In the book [_Building a Story Brand_](https://buildingastorybrand.com/), Donald Miller gives business owners a process for crafting effective stories. He calls the process _The StoryBrand 7-Part Framework (SB7)_.

One point of the framework: Customers aren't looking for a hero to rescue them. Customers are attracted to stories where they play the role of the hero, and they want to demonstrate power by rescuing themselves. 

And like the hero in any of our favorite stories, customers seek a guide who can help them develop into their heroism.

For example, in the _Star Wars_ movies, Luke Skywalker is the hero. To fully develop his heroism, Luke needed a guide, _Obi Wan Kenobi_ to point him along the correct path. The "hero needs a guide" theme is repeated in our favorite movies because it is a core component of human existence. When something is so important to us, we see it repeated in our literature. For example:

* Michael Corleone needed his father, Vito Corleone.
* King T'Challa needed his father, King T'Chaka.

And so on.

### The Role of the Business Owner 

>StoryBrand Principle One: The customer is the hero, not your brand.<br/><br/>~Donald Miller

If the customer is the hero of the story, what role do we play as business owners?

The business owner is the guide. We prode the path (in the form of a product or service) that enables the hero (the customer) to fully develop their heroic skills.

### Further Steps

_Building a Story Brand_ explores the SB7 Framework and the motivations behind it in detail. Well worth the reading time.

### Why This Works

You may recall the proverb: _A confused mind always says no_. Humans find comfort in clarity and we are repulsed by confusion.

Humans remember stories better than 

Humans remember stories. Humans are moved by stories. Before we had the written word, we told each other stories to get our points accross. With writing, stories live even longer.

>In a story, audiences must always know who the hero is, what the hero wants, who the hero has to defeat to get what they want, what tragic thing will happen if the hero doesn't win, and what wonderful thing will happen if they do.<br/><br/>The same is true for the brand you represent.<br/><br/>~Donald Miller
