Alexis Finch ([@agentfin](https://twitter.com/agentFin)) captured Sketchnotes for a [RubyMotion](http://rayhightower.com/blog/2012/10/29/building-ios-apps-with-ruby-motion/) presentation that I gave for [Groupon's Geekfest](http://meetup.com/geekfest). 

Sketchnotes are typography and drawing and notes all mixed together.

Alexis is remarkable. It's challenging enough to capture text notes during a presentation. But Alexis managed to turn the talk into meaningful graphics in real time. Something amazing is happening between the ears of Alexis!

Mike Rohde ([@rohdesign](http://twitter.com/rohdesign)) developed Sketchnotes when he became frustrated with note-taking. Mike is the go-to guy for anything related to Sketchnotes. He has published videos and a book [describing the process](http://rohdesign.com/sketchnotes/).

Thank you Alexis and Mike for sharing your artistic insights, and thank you Groupon for having me at Geekfest.
