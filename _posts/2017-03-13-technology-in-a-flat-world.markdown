### Change is Real

Change has always been with us. When change happens in the business world, companies can either adapt or die.

Author Thomas Friedman argues that the flattening of our planet is one of the latest changes to affect the world of business. How does a business decision-maker lead a team to benefit from this most recent change? A few throught-provoking ideas are presented here.

### Flatness Defined

_The World is Flat_ by [Thomas L. Friedman](http://www.thomaslfriedman.com/) was published in 2005 and rapidly became a bestseller. Friedman de nes a  at world as one where intellectual work and intel- lectual capital can be created anywhere and delivered anywhere.

Consider a local fast-food example: Today, if you visit a McDonald’s drive- through in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, the order taker isn’t even located in the restaurant. Drive-through customers are actually speaking with a rep in Colorado Springs, Colorado, over 900 miles away. The order conversation (along with a digital photo) is carried from Missouri to Colorado via high-speed data lines, the same lines. Cooks in the kitchen fill the order, and the delivery clerk matches you to your order by looking at your digital photo.

One rep in Colorado can handle multiple restaurants around the coun- try. Or even the world. The results: Faster service, more accurate orders, and lower costs.

### Digitized Work Done Anywhere

In past decades, factory workers watched as their jobs were shipped to low wage-earners in other countries. White collar workers felt safe because it seemed that so-called brain-work would always remain local. No longer. Today your American income tax return may be processed by accountants in India. The electronics in your PC may be designed in Malaysia and emailed to a factory in China. Web sites are developed in Ghana and bill collectors ply their trade from call centers in Canada and the Caribbean. We live in a world where in- tellectual work can be created anywhere and delivered anywhere. As Friedman would say, the world is flat.
