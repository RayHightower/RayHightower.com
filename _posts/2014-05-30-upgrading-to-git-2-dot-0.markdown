Developers of Git are making a serious effort to improve intuitiveness for first-time users. Of course, all users benefit from intuitive tools. When our tools _just work_, we spend less time sifting through documentation and more time solving problems for our customers.

###How to Upgrade
If you‚Äôre on Mac OS X, make sure you‚Äôre using [Homebrew](/blog/2014/02/12/homebrew-fundamentals/). It‚Äôs the easiest way to install and manage Unix libraries on the Mac.

It‚Äôs usually a good idea to check your current version before upgrading.

```bash
$ git --version
git version 1.9.2

$ 

```
Next, make sure that Homebrew is current.

```bash
$ brew doctor

Warning: Your Homebrew is outdated.
You haven't updated for at least 24 hours, this is a long time in brewland!
To update Homebrew, run `brew update`.

$ 

```

My Homebrew was outdated, so I used `brew update` to grab the new packages.

```bash
$ brew update
Updated Homebrew from b46160b8 to afff2b23.

aces_container                    git-number                      picolisp
apache-spark                    homebrew/versions/mongodb24       probatron4j

...

$ 

```

Next, use Homebrew to upgrade Git.

```bash
$ brew upgrade git

$ 
```

Finished. Let's check the Git version to confirm that the upgrade went properly.

```bash
$ git --version
git version 2.0.0

$ 

```

Future articles will examine the this latest version of Git in detail. For now, enjoy!
