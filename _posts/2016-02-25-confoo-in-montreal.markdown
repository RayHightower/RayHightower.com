[ConFoo](http://confoo.ca) is a nine-track conference for web developers, held every year in Montreal, Canada. Multiple languages and framework are represented: Python, .Net, Ruby, C#, JavaScript... the works. ConFoo also offered a healthy helping of IoT: Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Parallella (presented by this author).
