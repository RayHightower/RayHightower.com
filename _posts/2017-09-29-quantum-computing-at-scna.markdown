Like any new technology, quantum computing, is subject to hype, misinformation, and inflated expectations. How does a serious professional sort through the noise? By being particular about where you get information, and by seeking out experts.

SCNA can help you with both.

### Quantum Computing, in Person

[Professor Federico Spedalieri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/federico-spedalieri-06b9ba5/) is a 20-year veteran of quantum computing. He began studying the field as a PhD student at [Caltech](http://www.caltech.edu/). Today, he is the research lead on quantum computing at the [University of Southern California (USC)](https://news.usc.edu/104391/worlds-most-powerful-quantum-computer-now-online-at-usc/). If you attend [SCNA](https://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.com/) this year, you will hear him speak in person. You'll have the opportunity to ask questions and interact. And your knowledge will grow.

### Why Quantum Computing Matters

Classical computers, like the one you're probably using to view this blog post, have taken us far. But some problems require a different approach.

For example, consider drug research. Drugs are chemical compounds, made up of atoms and molecules. To simulate drug behavior, researchers must account for interactions between every proton, neutron, and electron in the drug molecule.

This doesn't present a problem for small molecules. Hydrogen, with one proton and one electron, has only one interaction. But the number of potential interactions grows exponentially as the size of the molecules increases.

Classical computers bog down under the weight of an exponentially increasing number of interactions. But quantum computers, based on our observations about quantum mechanics, can handle more interactions. Quantum computers will enable drug researchers to simulate much more complicated drugs. Cures for some of our most deadly diseases may be on the horizon, thanks to advances in quantum computing.

Quantum computing offers exciting answers. Learn more at SCNA.

### Striving Towards Mastery

Some folks are content to perform at their current level of skill. They deliver an acceptable level of results at work, and they’re fine. But some professionals have a burning desire for mastery. People with this burning desire to master a craft tend to gather together. To learn from each other. To challenge each other to grow.

SCNA is a conference that attracts developers with a burning desire to achieve mastery in software development. To hone their skills continuously over time, and to deliver better results for clients and other stakeholders.

Do you have a driving desire to achieve? Then perhaps SCNA is for you.

### Come to SCNA

Are you a software developer looking to take your skills to the next level? Consider the SCNA conference, arriving in Los Angeles on October 27, 2017. Learn from industry leaders. Network with your peers, trade ideas, and have a great time with a room full of smart people who will welcome you. [Register now](https://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.com/).
