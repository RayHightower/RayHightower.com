>One purpose of a conference is to help you to spot trends while there’s still time to reap the benefits of being an early adopter.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>~Brian Marick at SCNA 2013

Like any new technology, quantum computing, is subject to hype, misinformation, and inflated expectations. How does a serious professional sort through the noise? By being particular about where you get your information, and by seeking out experts.

SCNA can help you with that.

### Quantum Computing, in Person

[Professor Federico Spedalieri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/federico-spedalieri-06b9ba5/) is a 20-year veteran of the quantum computing field. He began studying the field as a PhD student at [Caltech](http://www.caltech.edu/). Today, he is the research lead on quantum computing at the [University of Southern California (USC)](https://news.usc.edu/104391/worlds-most-powerful-quantum-computer-now-online-at-usc/). If you attend [SCNA](https://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.com/) this year, you will hear him speak in person. You'll have the opportunity to ask questions and interact. And your knowledge will grow.

### Why Quantum Computing Matters

Classical computers, like the one you're probably using to view this blog post, have taken us far. But some problems require a different approach. 

Quantum computing offers an exciting answer.

### Striving Towards Mastery

Some folks are content to perform at their current level of skill. They deliver an acceptable level of results at work, and they’re fine. But some professionals have a burning desire for mastery. People with this burning desire to master a craft tend to gather together. To learn from each other. To challenge each other to grow.

SCNA is a conference that attracts developers with a burning desire to achieve mastery in software development. To hone their skills continuously over time, and to deliver better results for clients and other stakeholders.

Do you have a driving desire to achieve? Then perhaps SCNA is for you.

### Come to SCNA
