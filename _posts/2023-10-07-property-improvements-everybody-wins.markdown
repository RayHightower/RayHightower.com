One thing that excites me about the real estate business: It it possible to structure deals so that everybody wins. Here's what I mean:

* Residents win when we buy a property and improve it. We're giving them a great place to win.
* Investors win because our improvements make it possible for the property to generate more income. The additional income is shared between our investors and our team.

Wonderful things happen when a plan comes together!

We shot the above video on a Sunday morning. I was walking through one of our properties, one of our first deals in the State of Arizona.

I'm especially proud of this especially of all the things that I was able to learn from my partners I like to partner with people who know more than me we've made some amazing improvements to this property we've replaced all the electrical panels thereby improving the safety of the property and reducing our insurance expense we have added French drains to the parking lot to improve the draining of the parking lot so water doesn't run up against the building and cause cause of other damage that that water tends to do unless you take preventive measures we've added washers and dryers inside of the units we've replaced the roofs on the buildings we've made so many improvements here and in the end our residents get a great place to live we buy multi-family apartment properties fix them up and give people a great place to live and in the end our investors get Capital preservation tax advantages and a solid return on investment this is Ray Hightower be well
