Something that excites me about the real estate business: It it possible to structure deals so that everybody wins. Here's what I mean:

* Residents win when we buy a property and improve it. We're giving them a great place to live.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
* Investors win because our improvements make it possible for the property to generate more income. The additional income is shared between our investors and our team.

Wonderful things happen when we structure a deal in the right way!

### Sunday Morning Walk-Through

We shot the above video on a Sunday morning. I was walking through one of our properties, one of our first deals in the State of Arizona.

### Improvements Made

This property makes me especially proud. As we go through the asset management process, I continue to learn from my partners on this deal. Here are some of the improvements we've made:

* We replaced all the electrical panels. This makes the apartments safer for our residents, while reducing our insurance expense.

* We have added French drains to the parking lot to improve water drainage. This prevents water from running against the building. Left unchecked, water can cause other damage.

* Added washers and dryers inside of the units. This makes laundry more convenient.

* Replaced the roofs on the buildings.

We've made so many improvements here and in the end our residents get a great place to live.
