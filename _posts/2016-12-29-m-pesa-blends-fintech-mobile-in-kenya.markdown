M-Pesa is the mobile payment service that dominates Kenya. M-Pesa runs on mobile phones, and you can use it to pay for almost anything. M-Pesa is used by Kenyans regardless of income level, technical skill, or location (urban or rural). In 2015, 42% of the Kenyan GDP was processed through M-Pesa.

“Pesa” is the Swahili word for money, and the “M" stands for mobile. My first M-Pesa experience happened during [RubyConf Kenya](/blog/2016/05/08/rubyconf-kenya-2016/) in May 2016. So many developers at the conference raved about the service that I had to try it.

### Running on the SIM Card




The Swahili word for money is "pesa". M-Pesa is the mobile payment service used by _everybody_ in Kenya. M-Pesa runs on mobile phones, and you can use it to pay for almost anything. Everyone in Kenya uses it, regardless of income level, technical skill, etc.

#RubyConfKenya has proven to be hotbed of...
As ‪#‎RubyConfKenya‬ draws to a close, can't help reflecting on all I have learned about tech and biz at this conference.

Big item on my list: The Swahili word for money is "pesa". M-Pesa is the mobile payment service used by _everybody_ in Kenya. M-Pesa runs on mobile phones, and you can use it to pay for almost anything. Everyone in Kenya uses it, regardless of income level, technical skill, etc.




Even more remarkable: I've met Kenyan software developers who are building apps and businesses on top of the M-Pesa payment system. Way to jump on an opportunity! The M-Pesa ecosystem is a cool blend of financial technology, mobile communications, and user experience. You know that the UX is solid because everyone in Kenya uses M-Pesa.

Did I mention that everyone in Kenya uses M-Pesa? That one point has my head spinning. Bitcoin is used by a small subset of humans, but M-Pesa is accessible to everyone. "Lipa na M-Pesa" means "pay with M-Pesa". That's powerful!

### Success Has Many Fathers
Where did M-Pesa come from? Who invented it?

### M-Pesa vs Bitcoin

A comparison between M-Pesa and Bitcoin might not make sense to people who understand the blockchain. But I think the comparison has value because:

* Both are methods of payment that avoid paper currency.
* Both have the potential to disrupt the banking system.

In the 1990s internet, tech-minded people used services like Archie, Gopher, and IRC. But the masses didn't start using the internet until the web hit in the mid 1990s.

Early adopters are willing to put up with a few headaches/obstacles. But the masses of people want something easy to use. That's where M-Pesa fits the bill.

### Hakikisha

[Hakikisha](https://glosbe.com/swh/en/-hakikisha) means to affirm, verify, or certify in Swahili. M-Pesa's Hakikisha service is one more layer of protection.


### How to Benefit from M-Pesa

Now that we have a quick overview of what M-Pesa is, how can a bright entrepreneur turn this knowledge into an opportunity?

One US-based developer said to me: "But Ray, Kenya's population is smaller s in the USA. They also have a smaller GDP.” Both points are true, but they miss the point. 
My response: You're missing the point. The creators have built a product with:
* A footprint small enough to run on any mobile device, from the cheapest flip phone to the most advanced iPhone or Android device.
* A user experience that's so intuitive that everyone I spoke with in Kenya uses it. The numbers back this up. 

Any time we have a product used by so many people, from such a diverse set of backgrounds, network effects come into play. Safaricom is in an excellent position to benefit from the network they've built. Somewhere, maybe sometime soon, a smart group of developers will build on top of the M-Pesa platform and benefit, too.

What an exciting time to be in fintech!
