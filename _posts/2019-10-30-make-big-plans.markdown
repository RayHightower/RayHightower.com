>Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir the blood and probably themselves will not be realized. Make big plans; aim high in hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded will never die, but long after we are gone be a living thing, asserting itself with ever-growing insistency.
&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
~Daniel Burnham

Burnham is known as a pioneer of the [Chicago school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_school_(architecture)) of architecture. The Chicago Fire of 1871 leveled most of the city, giving architects a clean slate to create newer, fireproof buildings tall enough to be called skyscrapers. Although Burnham's quote may have initially applied to Chicago, his words fit enterprise that requires significant human effort.

Example: The [San Francisco Bay-Delta Model](https://www.spn.usace.army.mil/Missions/Recreation/Bay-Model-Visitor-Center/) shown in the above photograph. Make no little plans.

Make no little plans.

### The Model



### Conclusion

Launching [Bridgetown Partners](http://bridgetownpartners.com) has caused me to consider many options for the growth of the company. Part of planning involves gathering data and absorbing inspiration from other successful plans. Burnhamâ€™s plans for Chicago have inspired generations of entrepreneurs.

>Make big plans; aim high in hope and work...

Make big plans, indeed.
