Computers powered by artificial intelligence can beat humans at games. IBM’s Big Blue defeated chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1996. Alphabet's AlphaGo defeated a champion Go player, Lee Sedol, in 2015.

Game-playing machines are impressive when they win. But such machines are highly specialized, which makes them ineffective in the business world. What about general purpose AI, software that can mimic human intelligence and make human decisions? What about applications beyond games?

Dr. Kai-Fu Lee examines these questions in his book, [AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order](https://aisuperpowers.com). Lee draws on his background as a pioneering AI researcher and successful entrepreneur to explain why certain subsets of AI produce results, and how readers of the book might benefit.

### Rules, Neural Nets, and Deep Learning

In their quest to mimic human intelligence, AI researchers in the 1980s pursued two primary paths.

* Rules-based systems. Long chains of if-then-else rules 
* Neural networks. Rather than try to think of every possible scenario up from, the idea is to expose the system to a wide variety of circumstances that force the system to "learn" the desired behavior. For example, a certain robot designed by Boston Dynamics learns how to walk every time the sytem is rebooted.

Today, in the year 2019, most researchers refer to neural networks by their new name: deep learning.

General purpose AI that mimics human intelligence continues to elude researchers. Fortunately, one subset of AI, deep learning, is already delivering results in professions that were once considered beyond automation. Deep learning will quickly engulf us, eliminating many of our so-called "safe" professions as early as 2030. So says Dr. Kai-Fu Lee, author of the book 

### What Is Deep Learning?

Deep learning is ...


### GPU Acceleration

Graphics processing units (GPUs) are specialized processors which were originally designed to perform the calculations necessary for advanced graphics.

### Jobs Less Likely to be Replaced by AI

Jobs that require human creativity and human compassion, two things that AI cannot do.

### About the Kai-Fu Lee

For deeper insight into _AI Superpowers_, it might be helpful to know more about the author.

Dr. Kai-Fu Lee is a PhD computer scientist and founder of Sinovation Ventures, a $2 billion technology investment firm with offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Seattle, and Silicon Valley. Prior to launching Sinovation Ventures, Lee served as Google’s highest ranking executive in China. Lee’s resume includes engineering and leadership positions at Microsoft, Silicon Graphics, and Apple.

Lee was born in China. He was sent to the USA at the age of eleven because his mother wanted him to be educated beyond the rote memorization curriculum that was locally available. Lee’s mother required him to write to her weekly in Chinese
