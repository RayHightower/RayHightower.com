How does a team achieve greater success even in the midst of irksome obstacles and headwinds? Through partnerships.

Arizona is a business-friendly state. And I've had the good fortune to meet and collaborate with some amazing partners on several multifamily deals.

In particular, I would cite [Adrian Diaz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriandiazteam/) and [Colby Fryar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colby-fryar-295083208/). The three of us have learned through experience that when each of us operates in his area of strength, the whole team achieves more.

Sounds like something from [Who Not How](/blog/2021/05/29/who-not-how/), doesn't it?
