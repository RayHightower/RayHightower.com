My partners and I are buyers of multifamily apartment properties.

How do we decide where to buy? We look at three key factors: Job growth, income growth, and population growth.

Job growth is the most important of the three. Job growth is a leading predictor of  investment growth. When we buy in areas of job growth, we find a steady supply of rent-paying residents.

* Our investors get preservation of capital, tax advantages, and a solid return on investment.
