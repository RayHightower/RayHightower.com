Why did SpeakerDeck decide to complicate the embed process?

<blockquote class="embedly-card"><h4><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/rayhightower/exploring-parallelism-with-raspberry-pi-and-nvidia-jetson-nano">Exploring Parallelism with Raspberry Pi and Nvidia Jetson Nano</a></h4><p>The free lunch provided by Moore's Law is running out. Still, customers will always want more performance. Parallelism (especially with GPUs) clears a path for software developers to deliver more. This talk offers an exploration of parallelism and artificial intelligence on GPUs with open source tools like Python and Clojure.</p></blockquote>

Does the embed work? Is this a play for advertising dollars? How can I make embeds work the old way?
