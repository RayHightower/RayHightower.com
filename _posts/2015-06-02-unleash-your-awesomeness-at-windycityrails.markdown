Are you driven to excel? Do you see yourself here?

* **You have already built a successful Rails app**. Now that you're "done", you know you can make it better, but you're not sure how. You want to take your skills to the next level.

* **You recently graduated** from [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com), [Starter League](http://thestarterleague.com), [Mobile Makers](http://www.mobilemakers.co/) or another school. You're ready to meet and interact with your next generation of mentors.

* **You are no longer a beginner**. You have seen _advanced_ developers in action, and you are determined to get there yourself.

* **You are a beginner who learns quickly**. Maybe you're a seasoned professional with a track record in another field. You want to meet people (perhaps mentors?) who can help you accelerate through the beginner phase so you can launch something useful on the web.

Common thread: It's time to unleash the awesomeness in your bones. You want to take your skills to the next level, and you are ready to tackle _Big League Problems_. [WindyCityRails](http://windycityrails.org) is for you.

### What is a Big League Problem?

Growth-oriented people view big league problems as _good_ problems. For example, the Rails app you built is pulling in customers, and you're bumping into the limits of your software architecture. Who knew that so many people would buy from you! 

Now... How do you scale? Do you buy more hardware, change your architecture, choose a new platform, or some combination of these? The presenters at this year's WindyCityRails have dealt with scaling problems. Scaling an app, scaling a team, scaling a management structure... If you expect to encounter challenges, it makes sense to learn from the mistakes (and triumphs) of others. Put their experience to work for you.

### Awesome Speakers. Awesome Audience.

Check out the [complete list of WindyCityRails speakers](http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/) and ask yourself what you can learn from each one.

Remember that only 300 WindyCityRails tickets will be sold. Our speakers enjoy interacting with audience members throughout the conference. As professionals, they are always learning, too!
