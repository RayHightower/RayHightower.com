When we face adversity, are we prepared to be honest with ourselves? 

When we are honest with ourselves and our fellow stakeholders, we can move forward and solve problems.

### Brotherly Wisdom

My brother, Edward Hightower, is a remarkable business leader. 

Here's what Edward likes to say about adversity: "Bad news does not get better with time."

When we face adversity, it can be very difficult to first confront the adversity ourselves, to share the adversity with our stakeholders, and then begin working on the problem. But until we do that, we don't get to the point where we're working on the problem. 

### Accountability

One of the ways, one of the techniques that we can use to make sure we face adversity is to have partners who will hold us accountable. I am very fortunate to be working with Adrian Diaz and Colby Fryar. We hold each other accountable, and we stare adversity in the face together. 

Sometimes one of us is more optimistic than the other three and does not see the adversity, and the others will point that out to him.

I must admit sometimes, many times, I'm the one that's the most optimistic. Colby and Adrian will point that out to me. So then we can face the problem and deal with it. We can face the problem honestly, evaluate the alternatives, isolate whatever the core issue is, and then deal with it aggressively and fiercely.

### Others In Our Corner

Bottom Line: When facing adversity, sometimes we need other people in our corner that can call us on our BS so that we can deal with adversity fiercely and aggressively. 

Our honesty is enhanced and improved when we are collaborating with colleagues who will help us to recognize the adversity, help us to confront us, help us to brainstorm solutions and help us to execute. 

When a team operates on that level, it is very fulfilling. And more importantly, it is very effective.
