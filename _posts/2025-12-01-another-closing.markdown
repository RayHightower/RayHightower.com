The [ROIClear](https://ROIClear.com) team has closed another deal. Just in time for year-end!

Shout out to our partners at Asym Capital (Hunter Thompson and Tyler Lyons) and Keljam Properties (Jimmy McGrath) for a smooth collaboration.

Highlights:

* Class B. Built in 1981.
* 56 units. 98% occupied.
* $10.4 million purchase price.
* Eligible for 100% Bonus Depreciation in 2025. Please see your CPA and/or tax advisor for details on anything related to taxes.
* Purchased from a "Mom & Pop" seller who owned the asset for 35 years.
* Purchase price = $186k/unit. Similar asset across the street sold for $300k/unit in 2022. So the basis is low.
