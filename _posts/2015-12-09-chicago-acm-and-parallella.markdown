### Learning About Parallelism

Mooreâ€™s Law is running out. If developers want to extract more performance out of our silicon wafers, we need to explore new programming paradigms like parallelism. The Parallella single board computer offers an inexpensive way for devs to experiment with parallel programming theory. You can [get started with Parallella here](/blog/2014/07/07/parallella-quick-start-guide-with-gotchas/). Check it out!
