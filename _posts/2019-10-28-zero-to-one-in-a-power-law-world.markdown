>~Peter Thiel’s contrarian question

Peter Thiel is a silicon Valley billionaire, co-founder of multiple successful startups (including PayPal), and a venture capitalist. In those roles, Thiel asks _the contrarian question_ while interviewing job candidates. 

The question is simple, but difficult to answer because it requires the respondent to express an unpopular opinion. As observed in the book _Zero to One_, courage is less common than genius.

### Successful Contrarians

A good answer to the _contrarian question_ might look like this:

>Most people believe in x, but the truth is the opposite of x.

Answer the question well, and you might launch a massively successful enterprise. For example:

* 1970s: Most people believed that computers were big, mysterious devices that belonged in glass data centers. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Paul Allen, and Steve Wozniak envisioned a computer on every desktop. Microsoft and Apple were born.

* 1990s: The major search engines were a mess of advertisements and distractions. Larry Page and Sergey Brin believed that the search page should be sparse, and ads could be displayed with search results, but only if results were delivered quickly. They launched Google.

* Early 2010s: Major auto makers believed that electric vehicles were impractical, and if built they could only be ugly. Tesla figured out how to deliver _green_ results in attractive, high-performance electric cars. And now they're solving the mass production challenge.

Most people think that new ideas are crazy. Contrarians will push ahead anyway.

### Zero to One: Explained

The author explains the _Zero to One_ concept with the following charts. Both charts are expressions of progress. In the first chart, doing something new is expressed via movement along the vertical axis, while copying things that work is shown via movement along the horizontal.

Vertical progress, doing something new, is harder because nobody has seen it before. For example, making typewriters in the year 1970 would be an example of horizontal progress because typewriters were common in that year. But creating a word processor (Wang, IBM DisplayWriter, etc.) would be vertical because word processors had never been seen before.

Zero to One is the idea of creating the first version of something useful.


### Building Companies Using Zero to One

Building on the two contrar... questions shared at the beginning of this post, Thiel believes that there are seven questions that every business must answer in order to achieve greatness:

1. The <b>Engineering</b> Question<br/>
Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements? 
2. The <b>Timing</b> Question 
Is now the right time to start your particular business? 
3. The <b>Monopoly</b> Question<br/>
Are you starting with a big share of a small market? 
4. The <b>People</b> Question<br/>
Do you have the right team? 
5. The <b>Distribution</b> Question<br/>
Do you have a way to not just create but deliver your product? 
6. The <b>Durability</b> Question<br/>
Will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future? 
7. The <b>Secret</b> Question<br/>
Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don’t see?





 







## Out-Takes

>Instead of fighting a war, look for ways to delight customers that they have never experienced before.

>~Peter Thiel, Venture Capitalist and Serial Entrepreneur

The best companies serve customers in new, non-trivial ways. A few examples: Google and Tesla. 

Google was not the first search engine; over ten search engines had a healthy head-start. But Google was the first to serve two key sets of customers simultaneously:
* Web users, who want quick search results with minimal clutter. Google's search page is spartan.
* Advertisers, who want to influence buyers right at the point of decision. A person using Google to search for a product is likely to buy that product very soon, maybe within minutes if the product is available online. 

Tesla was not the first electric car company. But Tesla figured out how to deliver _green_ results in an attractive, high-performance automobile.

How will future entrepreneurs build great businesses? _Zero to One_ explores recent business history to provide some answers.



Peter Thiel is a member of _The PayPal Mafia_, that group of PayPal founders and early employees who went on to launch other successful ventures. In addition to Thiel, the PayPal Mafia includes Elon Musk (SpaceX and Tesla), Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn), and .

Why have the alums of PayPal enjoyed so much success while so many startups wither and die? The author explores this and other questions in the book _Zero to One_.



### Contrari... Questions
Two of Thiel's favorite interview questions are...

* What important truth do very few people agree with you on?
* What valuable company is nobody building?

 Most customers only understand new products in the context of old products. Henry Ford's customers might have [asked for a faster horse](/blog/2014/01/15/henry-ford-faster-horse/). 




### The PayPal Mafia

The PayPal Mafia is a group of

The group includes Elon Musk (SpaceX, Tesla), Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn), and Peter Thiel, author of the book Zero to One.

PayPal was led by six people who went on to be regarded as the "PayPal Mafia". Peter Thiel is one of them.
