Buffett has lived by the above words for decades. He learned this approach from his mentor, Benjamin Graham.

### Distress Leads to Opportunity

And now, those of us who invest in large multifamily properties will soon have a chance to apply the Buffett quote. The multifamily real estate market is showing early signs of distress. Fear and opportunity are in the air.

### Next Steps

The commercial/multifamily real estate business thrives on deals and dollars. We need properties to run, investors with capital, and lenders to round out the capital stack.

If you're a syndicator, now's a great time to strengthen relationships with brokers, sellers, lenders... every person that you need on your team to get a deal done.

If you're a passive investor, take a good look at the syndicators that you're dealing with. Which ones are in the best position to handle the upcoming storm? 

What an exciting time to be in this business!
