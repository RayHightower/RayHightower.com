Last week, [Coraline Ehmke](https://twitter.com/bantik) and [Liz Abinante](https://twitter.com/feministy) met with three members of the WindyCityRails organizer team: [Kevin Zolkiewicz](https://twitter.com/zolk), [Alonda McCree](https://twitter.com/themccreefiles), and me. Good dialog. End result: The updated [WindyCityRails Code of Conduct](http://www.windycityrails.org/code-of-conduct/).

<!--more-->

Harassment is a serious issue, and a 140-character tweet will not do the discussion justice. Therefore, the ChicagoRuby organizers have created multiple communication channels for this issue:


* Email: codeofconduct@chicagoruby.org
* Any of the contact names listed on the current code of conduct
* Phone number listed on the code of conduct

If you have concerns in this area, please feel free to use one of the channels. The contact list may change as responsibilities shift within ChicagoRuby. However, there will always be multiple people available to address harassment concerns.

Thank you Coraline and Liz for your work in making this happen. And thank you [Ken Walters](https://twitter.com/lostghost) of [Brad’s Deals](http://twitter.com/bradsdeals) for facilitating the meeting.

Now, let’s go write some code!
