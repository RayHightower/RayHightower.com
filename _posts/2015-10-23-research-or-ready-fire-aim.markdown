>First rule of user research: Never ask anyone what they want.  <br/>~Erika Hall, author of “Just Enough Research"

It is popular to view entrepreneurs as risk takers. After 20+ years running WisdomGroup, I’m not sure that’s an accurate view. From what I've observed, successful entrepreneurs will reduce risk before launching a venture.

### Pothole Metaphor

When most people see a road full of potholes, they avoid the road. But an entrepreneur, looking at the same pothole-filled road, will devise ways to navigate over and around the obstacles. Some people avoid risk outright. Entrepreneurs reduce risk through creativity.

### Risks in Software Development

Software development is risky. Bugs are an obvious risk. Fortunately, we have techniques (like test driven development) that improve software quality and reduce the impact of bugs. Another risk, perhaps bigger: What if the software solves a problem that nobody cares about? You could spend millions of dollars building software that never generates a return on investment.

[Just Enough Research](http://abookapart.com/products/just-enough-research) by Erika Hall offers ways to study users so that software makers can build products that meet user needs. When needs are met, people will buy.

### Observation Beats Asking

Humans are funny creatures. If someone asks us outright what we need, we don't always know how to answer. Partially because it's very difficult for us to study ourselves; we're a little bit too close to the object of study. And we don't always know the [list of available options](/blog/2014/01/15/henry-ford-faster-horse/). The best user research is conducted by a curious yet non-judgmental third party.
