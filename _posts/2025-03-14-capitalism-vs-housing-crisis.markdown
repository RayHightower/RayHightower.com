[Bethany Finch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bethany-finch-amhs/) is a dynamic and creative entrepreneur. She and I had a chance to catch up during RaiseFest '25 in Phoenix.

In this clip, we discuss Bethany's ideas for solving the housing crisis by creating a structure where multiple stakeholders work together. What an amazing idea!

### Capitalism Done Right

> Find a need and fulfill it. Successful businesses are founded on the needs of people.
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>~A. G. Gaston

Just like any outstanding entrepreneur, Bethany has built her business to address certain needs within the market:

* Amazon needs employees, and those employees need housing.
* Investors need a way for their money to earn money.

Through hard work and wit, Bethany and her team have built systems to satisfy the needs of multiple stakeholders at once. Amazon, the employees of Amazon, and investors. They are using entrepreneurship to help solve the housing crisis.

That's how capitalism works. And it is wonderful!
