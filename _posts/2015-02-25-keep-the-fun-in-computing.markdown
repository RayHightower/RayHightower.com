>"I think that it’s extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep fun in computing... What’s in your hands, I think and hope, is intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more than when you were first led up to it, that you can make it more."

Enrolling in the [Chicago SICP study group](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/sicp-chicago-w-dave-astels-tickets-15525870296), I expected to dive into Lisp. I expected to be challenged. What I didn’t expect: The fun, somewhat irreverent attitude of the SICP authors. And why not? Software development is one of our newest professions. Other professionals are made more effective through our work. Everybody benefits from the increase in productivity.

If you are a software developer in the Chicago area, be sure to check out [the SICP group](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/sicp-chicago-w-dave-astels-tickets-15525870296). As the SICP authors say, you don’t need to know Lisp to embark on this path; you’ll learn Lisp as we travel along. And our brains will be stretched in new and interesting ways.

What an exciting time to be alive!
