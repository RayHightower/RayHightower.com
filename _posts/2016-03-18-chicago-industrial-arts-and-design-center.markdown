>Don't just be stuck with an idea in your head. Build it, and get it in your hands.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>~Alan Baker of Chicago Industrial Arts & Design Center

The [Chicago Chapter](http://www.meetup.com/acm-chicago/events/229049466/) of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) hosted a special meeting at the Chicago Industiral Arts & Design Center ([CIADC](http://www.ciadc.org/)) on Wednesday evening. It's tempting to call CIADC a maker space because it certainly appeals to makers. But as the ACM group learned on Wednesday, CIADC stretches beyond making and into empowerment.
