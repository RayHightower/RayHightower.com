Something I found disturbing in the Rails community circa 2007: Too much emphasis on "magic". 


Much of the early enthusiasm for Rails was driven by a belief in "magic". This always disturbed me. As scientists and builders, the more we know about our tools, the better we can deliver great results for our clients. It's okay not to know something. But to simply dismiss what we don't know as "magic" while making zero effort to learn more is unacceptable.
