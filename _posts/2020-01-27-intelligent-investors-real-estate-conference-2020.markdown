The [Intelligent Investors Real Estate Conference]() was held Jan 25-26, 2020 in downtown Los Angeles. This post offers a snap-shot of the event.

### Summary

IIREC2020 was an amazing collection of investors and service providers, coming together to help each other and brainstorm ways to provide better value for all stakeholders: Owners, investors, residents, tenants... anyone who can benefit from well-run investment real estate operations.

### People

The IIREC2020 attendees made me feel most welcome at the event. Each is an owner, operator, investor, banker, service provider, or some combination of the above. Lawyers were on-hand to tell lawyer jokes. Other professions were well-represented, like the physician from central-USA looking to add to his portfolio.

### Business is Good



### Why Attend?

My conference calendar consists mainly of tech-focused events where I’ve built a solid network of contacts over the past few decades. IIREC was interesting because I didn’t know any of the other attendees prior to the conference. Launching [Bridgetown Partners]() has given me an opportunity to add to my professional network. Let the connecting begin!
