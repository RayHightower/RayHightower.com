Yesterday morning, I had a Skype call with [Mandla Magagula](https://twitter.com/mandlamag), a software developer based in Johannesburg, South Africa. By day he builds software. And when he’s not at work, Mandla and his team teach software craftsmanship to youth in Johannesburg.

We talked about [8th Light’s acquisition of WisdomGroup](https://8thlight.com/blog/paul-pagel/2016/09/12/8th-light-acquisition-wisdomgroup.html), and with a few minutes our conversation turned to [SCNA](http://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.com/).

I’ve had similar craftsmanship conversations with developers from other regions of Planet Earth.

When

What struck me about the conversation:

Craftsmanship is global.
The desire to improve, the desire to get better at one’s profession, that’s global.

Some people within a profession just want to go to work, do the bare minimum, and then go home. That’s okay… for them.
But some people want to continuously hone their skills, to strive towards mastery.
It’s possible to achieve mastery at a sustainable pace, without burning yourself out. The way to do that is by working with others who are on the path to mastery. We talk to each other, we listen to each other, and together we grow. Together we get better along the path to mastery.

That’s what SCNA is all about. In face, you could argue that the “NA” part of SCNA is a misnomer. SCNA is held in North America, but craftsmanship is a passion that goes far beyond the boundaries of one continent. The desire for craftsmanship is global.

If you feel this way, if you have a passion for excellence, come join us at SCNA. Let’s work towards mastery together.

SCNA has built a global reputation for excellence in education and networking.
