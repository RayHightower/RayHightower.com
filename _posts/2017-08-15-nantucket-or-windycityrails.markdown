Still, you should check out [WindyCityRails](http://windycityrails.com). The speakers are outstanding. And the opportunity to network with your fellow software professionals is something that cannot be passed up.

And here's a bonus for you. Use the discount code `8THLIGHT` for $50 off of the standard conference fee.

See you in September!
