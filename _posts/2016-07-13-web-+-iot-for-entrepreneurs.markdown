[Philip Fairweather](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philip-fairweather-67294312) and his team at the [Small Business Development Center at Bethel New Life](http://www.bethelnewlife.org/our-investments/community-economic-development/business-development/illinois-small-business-development-center/) are serious about creating opportunities for entrepreneurs. The team invited me to present at one of their entrepreneurship workshops this afternoon. Thank you Phil for the invitation and for an audience of driven entrepreneurs. Slides appear below.

### Next Steps

It is always exciting to be in a room full of entrepreneurs because entrepreneurs solve problems. I look forward to seeing great things from the SBDC at Bethel New Life!
