[RubyConf Kenya]() 2016 was a great blend of technology, business, and community. Visiting Kenya has been an amazing experience so far (I'm still in Kenya as I write this) and I expect to write more about my time here. 

A big "thank you" to the organizers of RubyConf Kenya for inviting me to present on Parallella and on entrepreneurship. The learning and networking at this conference has been rich. I was especially impressed with _M-Pesa_, the technology, the user experience, and the ecosystem. M-Pesa is worthy of a separate post on this blog.

### After the Conference: Nairobi GNU/Linux User Group

A fellow developer invited me to attend the [Nairobi GNU/Linux User Group](https://nairobilug.or.ke/) held at the [Tunapanda Institute](http://www.tunapanda.org/) on Saturday afternoon. The presenter, an instructor at Tunapanda, shared her experience with teaching tools for Scratch and PHP. The room was packed, roughly 25 people were in attendance.

After the meeting, I met system admins and devs who are deeply immersed in the Android space. They're developing on devices that are hard to get in the USA. Multi-SIM Android phones are common. One dev carries an Android with dual SIMs, eight (8) 64-bit cores, and the software tools to determine which core(s) are running at any given time. 

I still have a few more days in Kenya. More experiences to come!
