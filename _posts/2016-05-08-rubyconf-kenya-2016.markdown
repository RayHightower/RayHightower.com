[RubyConf Kenya]() 2016 was a great blend of technology, business, and community. Visiting Kenya has been an amazing experience so far (I'm still in Kenya as I write this) and I expect to write more about my time here. 

A big "thank you" to the organizers of RubyConf Kenya for inviting me to present on Parallella and on entrepreneurship. The learning and networking at this conference has been rich. I was especially impressed with _M-Pesa_, the technology, the user experience, and the ecosystem. M-Pesa is worthy of a separate post on this blog.

### After the Conference: Nairobi GNU/Linux User Group

A member of the East African software development community invited me to attend the [Nairobi GNU/Linux User Group]() on Saturday afternoon.  Another rich tech experience. I met devs who are deeply immersed in the Android mobile dev experience, espeically with devices that are unavailable in the USA. Several devs shared multi-SIM Android phones.  One carries an Android with dual SIMs, eight (8) 64-bit cores, and the software tools to determine which core(s) are running at any given time. 

I still have a few more days in Kenya. More experiences to come!
