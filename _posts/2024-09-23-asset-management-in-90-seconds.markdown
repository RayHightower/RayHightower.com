Last week, our partnership ([Adrian Diaz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriandiazteam/), [Colby Fryar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colby-fryar-295083208/), and [Ray Hightower](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rayhightower/)) spent a few hours with the property manager of our newest Tucson asset.

Partnership and collaboration are keys to success in this business.
