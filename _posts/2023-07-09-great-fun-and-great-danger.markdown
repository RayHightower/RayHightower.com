The waterfront area of any summer camp is a place of great fun and great danger.

Commercial real estate investing is similar.

### Great Fun

* Waterfront: Who doesn't want to go out on a boat, enjoying the waves (on a lake) or the rapids (on a river)? 
* CRE: Who doesn't want to invest in a CRE deal with solid ROI?

### Great Danger

* Waterfront: Better wear your life vest. And you'd better know how to swim!
* CRE: Better have strong underwriting skills on your team, along with asset managers and acquisitions specialists who know how to solve problems. And you'd better know how to navigate adversity and come out on top!

### Parallel Lessons

There are many parallels between waterfront safety and commercial real estate investing. I am grateful to the mentors who taught me so well, and I am grateful for the opportunity to pass lessons along to future generations.
