A few decades ago, I was introduced to a framework that describes the growth and hiccups of teams. Every team goes through these four stages:

* **Forming**. Right after the team launches, everyone is excited and happy to be working together.

* **Storming**. First disagreement. Members of the team are wondering "Why did we ever decide to work together?" Many teams die in the _storming_ stage.

* **Norming**. Team members have worked through the disagreement and they decide that they want to work together afterall. 

* **Performing**. Over time, team members figure out how they can best fit together. And the team engine begins to hum.

Why does a team go these stages? Because teams are made up of humans. Let's explore this model further.
