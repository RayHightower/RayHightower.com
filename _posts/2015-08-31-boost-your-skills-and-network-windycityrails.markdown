### New to Rails?

What if you're new to Rails? Should you attend? Yes. WindyCityRails is one of the best ways to build your network of fellow professionals. Our skills get stronger when we challenge each other in positive ways. 

### Rails Veteran?
Should Rails veterans attend? Yes. Every presentation will address the problems we face as a Rails app grows. Every speaker has wrestled with scaling issues. You'll learn how to balance theoretical computer science against the urgent need to get things done. Refactoring, testing, performance, cloud management, the future of Rails... topics you need to know in order to grow to the next level. 

Further, WindyCityRails attracts the kind of speakers who mix and mingle with the audience. Want to dig deeper into a scalability problem? Grab a chair next to one of the speakers and have a conversation!

### Entrepreneurs and Investors
Entrepreneurs should attend WindyCityRails if they're looking to build the next great technical team. Investors might discover the next Rails success story to invest in.
