Terrie Schafer, author of [Mindful Landlord](https://www.amazon.com/Mindful-Landlord-Rental-Property-Profit-ebook/dp/B09R2FQ4WY/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3DCCA817SO4IE&keywords=mindful+landlord&qid=1683743295&sprefix=mindful+landlord%2Caps%2C118&sr=8-1), is a real estate investor and a world champion martial artist. Her skills include kick boxing and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. 

The second edition of _Mindful Landlord_ covers lessons learned during the Covid pandemic, a time when landlords (and everyone else) were faced with new challenges and seemingly insurmountable obstacles.

Bottom line: I enjoyed this book. Yes, it discusses concepts that most investors already know: How to find tenants, how to manage contractors, and the like. The book is unique because it challenges the reader to consider the _why_ behind the investments that we're making. Why do we want to earn more money? Do we invest because we want more consumer goods, or do we want to spend more time connecting with our friends and families? What steps can we take (within ourselves) to keep from reacting in anger when an interaction with a tenant or vendor doesn't go the way we planned? _Mindful Landlord_ explores these questions in a way that I find helpful.

Personally, I am an investor and a capitalist.
