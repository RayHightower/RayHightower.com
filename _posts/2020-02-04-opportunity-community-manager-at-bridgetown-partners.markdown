[Bridgetown Partners](https://bridgetownpartners.com) is hiring a Community Manager (CM) to help with the growth of our events and publications. This is a part-time, independent contractor position, mostly remote, with some on-site work for meetings and events. The position could evolve into full-time depending on the growth of the community and the performance of the CM.

### Smart People, Growing Together

Our community philosophy: _When smart people challenge each other to grow, great things happen_. Our team spent two decades building a solid reputation in Chicago's tech community. (See: <a href="/blog/2014/05/30/how-to-grow-a-user-group/">How to Grow a User Group</a>.) We intend to duplicate (and exceed) that track record here in Los Angeles.

The Community Manager will be a critical part of the team that builds the Bridgetown Partners community in LA.
