Our 10x performance journey begins with the rise of Michelangelo. 

At the age of  17, Michelangelo was an unknown artist obsessed with sculpting the human form as accurately as possible. To teach himself anatomy, he found and dissected dozens of human corpses. He literally risked his life to gain this knowledge; if the authorities had caught him "violating a corpse" he would have been put to death. Such was the law in Florence, Italy in 1493.

Thankfully, Michelangelo was never caught.

### Applied Anatomy

Michelangeo's mastery of human anatomy shows in his art, including his sculptures of Hercules and David, his painting of the Sistine Chapel, and in the works of students who sought him out as a mentor.

How did Michelangelo become such a remarkable artist? The authors of _10x is Easier Than 2x_ assert that he did so through the 10x process, although he would not have called it that at the time.

### What is 10x?



### Counterintuitive and Evidence-Based

_10x Is Easier Than 2x_ is a completely counterintuitive book by Dan Sullivan and Dr Benjamin Hardy, the same duo who penned [Who Not How](/blog/2021/05/29/who-not-how/) and [The Gap and the Gain](/blog/2022/09/29/achieve-more-measure-the-gain/).

 
### The Gap and the Gain

>When you’re measuring yourself against ideals, it’s like measuring yourself against the moving horizon and then being mad at yourself for not being at the horizon. News flash: You can’t ever reach the horizon.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>From the book 10x Is Easier Than 2x by Sullivan & Hardy

Sullivan and Hardy also wrote [The Gap and the Gain](/blog/2022/09/29/achieve-more-measure-the-gain/), and they reference the earlier book in `10x`.
