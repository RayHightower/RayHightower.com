Our 10x performance journey begins with the rise of Michelangelo. 

At the age of  17, Michelangelo was an unknown artist obsessed with sculpting the human form as accurately as possible. To teach himself anatomy, he found and dissected dozens of human corpses. He literally risked his life to gain this knowledge; if the authorities had caught him "violating a corpse" he would have been put to death. Such was the law in Florence, Italy in 1493.

Thankfully, Michelangelo was never caught.

### Applied Anatomy: 10x

Michelangeo's mastery of human anatomy shows in his art, including his sculptures of Hercules and David, his painting of the Sistine Chapel, and in the works of students who sought him out as a mentor.

How did Michelangelo become such a remarkable artist? The authors of _10x is Easier Than 2x_ assert that he did so through the 10x process, although he would not have called it that at the time.

### Reviewing the 80/20 Rule
If you're in business, you already know the 80/20 rule, also known as the Pareto Principal. Italian economist Wilfredo Pareto observed that 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the families. The rule shows up in other large statistical samples. On most sales teams, managers observe that 80% of the sales are closed by 20% of the salespeople. And so on.

Many business leaders find that 80% of our results are due to 20% of our actions. By way of example: It's usually more important to spend a half hour speaking face-to-face with a large client instead of spending an entire day sorting through files. The client conversation will likely lead to more revenue, while file sorting will only lead to a well-organized filing system. Yes, the files must be maintained! But a smart business leader will focus on revenue-generating tasks (like speaking with clients) and hire a team to manage the files.

To achieve 10x, we focus on the 20% and we delegate or partner with people who can do the rest.

### 2x is Typical, 10x is Exponential

To achieve a 2x improvement in performance, most of us can simply keep doing what we're already doing. Over time, we'll get better simply by doing the same thing over and over again.

But to achieve a 10x improvement, we need to be mindful and deliberate about the choices we make. To improve by a factor of ten, we need to focus on the 20% of our work at the intersection of excellence and passion. At the same time, we need to move away from the 80% of our tasks that can be better performed by someone else. 

The best business partnerships are those where each partner is focused on their own 20% with little or no overlap with their partner's 20%, and each partner's 80% is handled by other members of the team (including other partners).

We know Michelangelo today because he chose 10x, even though he probably didn’t call it that. The authors site several examples of Michaelangelo's 10x activities:

* Risking his life by learning anatomy from real human corpses, even though this activity was punishable by death.
* Spending his entire savings on a block of marble because it happened to be suitable for his next project. The result: Hercules.
* Accepting commissions from wealthy patrons _before_  he was entirely ready to perform the work, knowing that he had the determination and discipline to prepare himself in time for completion.

How To Implement 10x in Our Lives
Now that we understand the benefits of 10x, how do we implement it in our lives?




### Counterintuitive and Evidence-Based

_10x Is Easier Than 2x_ is a completely counterintuitive book by Dan Sullivan and Dr Benjamin Hardy, the same duo who penned [Who Not How](/blog/2021/05/29/who-not-how/) and [The Gap and the Gain](/blog/2022/09/29/achieve-more-measure-the-gain/).

 
### The Gap and the Gain

>When you’re measuring yourself against ideals, it’s like measuring yourself against the moving horizon and then being mad at yourself for not being at the horizon. News flash: You can’t ever reach the horizon.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>From the book 10x Is Easier Than 2x by Sullivan & Hardy

Sullivan and Hardy also wrote [The Gap and the Gain](/blog/2022/09/29/achieve-more-measure-the-gain/), and they reference the earlier book in `10x`.
