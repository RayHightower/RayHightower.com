[Traction](http://localhost:4001/blog/2021/02/15/traction-entrepreneurial-operating-system-eos/)'s chapter on _The Data Component_ describes a pilot flying over an ocean. During the flight, the pilot announces:

>I've got bad news and good news. The bad news is that our gauges are broken. We don't know how fast we're flying or in what direction, and we don't know our fuel level. The good news is that we're making great time!

Just as a pilot need gauges to fly an aircraft, an entrepreneur needs data to run an enterprise.
