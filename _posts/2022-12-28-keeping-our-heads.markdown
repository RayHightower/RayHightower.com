>If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you...<br/>&nbsp;<br/>~From the poem ["If" by Rudyard Kipling](/if-rudyard-kipling/)

### Hot Tempers

I'm at O'Hare Airport, headed home to Arizona after getting caught by this season's travel chaos. I like to fly Southwest Airlines. Two days ago, the airline cancelled over 75% of its flights due to inclement weather and a glitch in their scheduling system. The lines were long and some tempers got hot.

### Southwest Airlines Employees: Professional

Yet through it all, the Southwest employees who I interacted with kept their heads. They worked on the problem. They shared information as it became available to them.

Yes, my departure from Chicago was delayed by two days. But in that delay, I was able to spend more time with my family and friends in Chicago. And since most of my work is remote, there was minimal impact on my business. What a blessing!

I do not have a complete picture of the cause of the travel problems this week. Still, I must take my hat off to the Southwest employees for the way they are handling a tough problem. 

### Happy New Year

Happy New Year to all of you!
