Here's a test of business leadership: How does the team handle unexpected events?

One of our properties in Nashville, Tennessee caught fire on last week. This is a 145-unit property with multiple buildings spread over a large plot of land. One building is completely gone.

Fortunately, no people were hurt. Property and buildings can always be replaced. But human life is precious.

### Gratitude

Our team is grateful for many things regarding this incident, including:
* Zero loss of life.

* Excellent third-party management. They were on the scene immediately, and they made temporary living arrangements for the displaced residents.

* Smart systems and plans. Shout out to Rod Khleif and Scott Holmes of CREE Capital for their mentorship and systems. Insurance and safety systems on the property are solid thanks to their leadership.

### Be Prepared

Unexpected events are never easy. But when we prepare well, we can respond well. I am beyond grateful for a proactive team!
