The back cover of Gino Wickman's book <a href="/blog/2021/02/15/traction-entrepreneurial-operating-system-eos/">_Traction_</a> poses a powerful question:

Vision gives birth to a business. Traction makes the vision real. Earlier in this series, we covered the five components that are necessary to get the business moving in the right direction: [Vision](/blog/2021/03/08/vision-and-eos/), [People](/blog/2021/04/08/people-and-eos/), [Data](/blog/2022/02/04/data-plus-eos/), [Issues](/blog/2022/02/10/issues-plus-eos/), and [Process](/blog/2022/02/15/process-plus-eos/). This article summarizes the sixth component, Traction. 

Traction is so important that Wickman's entire book was named for it.

### What is the Traction Component?

Traction can be defined as how well something moves ahead without slipping. Tires need traction in order to move through snow. Companies need traction in order to move from vision to reality.
