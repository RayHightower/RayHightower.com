The back cover of Gino Wickman's book <a href="/blog/2021/02/15/traction-entrepreneurial-operating-system-eos/">_Traction_</a> poses a powerful question:

Vision gives birth to a business. Traction makes the vision real. Earlier in this series, we covered five components that are necessary to get the business moving in the right direction: [Vision](/blog/2021/03/08/vision-and-eos/), [People](/blog/2021/04/08/people-and-eos/), [Data](/blog/2022/02/04/data-plus-eos/), [Issues](/blog/2022/02/10/issues-plus-eos/), and [Process](/blog/2022/02/15/process-plus-eos/). This article summarizes the sixth component, Traction. 

Traction enables the entrepreneur to gain a grip on the business. Traction is so important that Wickman's entire book was named for this single component of [EOS](/blog/2021/02/15/traction-entrepreneurial-operating-system-eos/).

### What is the Traction Component?

Traction can be defined as how well something moves ahead without slipping. Tires need traction in order to move through snow. Companies need traction in order to move from vision to reality.

This article is part of a series on [Traction and the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS)](/blog/2021/02/15/traction-entrepreneurial-operating-system-eos/). EOS is a set of tools that enables a business leader to grow a company while maintaining sanity. Today's EOS component: Traction.

### Accountability and Discipline

Organizational consultants have learned that accountability and discipline are the areas of greatest weakness in most companies. The EOS tools are systems that instill accountability and discipline into the fiber of the organization. For example, 

### 90-Day Pulse

Many of the tools within EOS are based on observations about human behavior. For example, most humans and teams can stay focused on a project for about ninety days. After ninety days, our focus drifts and we tend to go off on tangents. That is why it's necessary for us to re-group and re-focus on the big picture goals every ninety days. The EOS tools support this 90-day pulse.

### Rocks and a Meeting Pulse

The term _Rock_ is borrowed from a business fable traced back to Steven Covey's _Seven Habits of Highly Effective People_. Imagine a glass container next to a pile of rocks, a bucket of sand, and a glass of water. If you want to get the rocks, sand, and water into the glass container, it's better to start with the rocks first. The gravel fills in the spaces between the rocks, sand fills in the spaces between the gravel, and the water completes the process.

Rocks represent the priorities that the organization must accomplish in the next ninety days. The leadership team chooses three to seven Rocks per quarter. Each Rock has a single person who is accountable for the Rock's success.


### Quarterly Meeting Pulse

90-Day Pulse


### Annual Meeting Pulse


### Level 10 Meetings

Rate the meeting from 1 to 10. Goal = 8.
