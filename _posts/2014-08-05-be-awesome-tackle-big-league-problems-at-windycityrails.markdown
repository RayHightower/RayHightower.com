Do you see yourself in any of these scenarios?

* You have already built a successful Rails app. Now that you're "done", you know you can make it better, but you're not sure how. You want to take your skills to the next level.

* You recently graduated from [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com), [Starter League](http://thestarterleague.com), [Mobile Makers](http://www.mobilemakers.co/) or another school. You're ready to meet and interact with your next generation of mentors.

* You are no longer a beginner. You have seen _advanced_ developers in action, and you are determined to get there yourself.

* Software development is relatively new to you, and you built a successful track record in another profession. You want to meet people who can help you accelerate through the beginner phase so you can launch something useful.

Common thread: It's time to unleash the awesomeness in your bones. You want to take your skills to the next level, and you are ready to tackle _Big League Problems_. [WindyCityRails](http://windycityrails.org) is for you.

###What are Big League Problems?
You might think of a big league problem as a good problem. For example, the Rails app you built is pulling in customers, and you're bumping into the limits of your software architecture. Who knew that so many people would buy from you? 

Now... How do you scale? Do you buy more hardware, change your architecture, choose a new platform, or some combination of these? [Dr. Nic Williams](http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#williams), [Brian Shirai](http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#shirai), [Evan Light](http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#light), [Mark Menard](http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#menard) deal with scaling problems. Learn from them.

Maybe you built a gem to solve a problem for yourself, and now you want to release your gem to the world. What legal questions do you need to consider? Did Rails face similar challenges in the beginning? [Daliah Saper](http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#saper) is an attorney who specializes in intellectual property and other open source software issues. Put her team to work for you.

How about security? Have you outgrown the `Devise` gem? Or do you simply need to know more about `Devise` internals so that you can use it more effectively? Maybe it's time to abandon username/password logins altogether and go with SQRL. [Justin Love](http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#love) and [Lucas Mazza](http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#mazza) might have some ideas for you.
