[SCNA](http://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.com/) has long been one of my favorite conferences. Reason: Rich conversations with other attendees. People who attend SCNA come from a wide range of developer communities and they represent most of the languages in use today. Each community grows stronger when we borrow good ideas from each other.

### Presenting Parallelism: Thanks!

The organizers of SCNA invited me (several months before [the acquisition](/blog/2016/09/12/8th-light-acquires-wisdomgroup/)) to present _Exploring Parallelism With Parallella and Raspberry Pi_. Thank you, organizers, for having me on stage.

### What’s Next?

One advantage of presenting to a room full of smart people: Feedback! Questions from the audience are always rich with new ideas. Lots of new paralleliism-related topics to explore. As always, I’ll post here as the discoveries unfold.
