When we experiment with something new, it can be encouraging to achieve a _quick win_ early in the process. Achieving a quick win can give us that jolt of energy we need to keep us going past (and through) the inevitable roadblocks.

This post is designed to give you a quick win with the Raspberry Pi Model 3. Within this single article, you will learn how to:

* Download and install an operating system for your Raspberry Pi.
* Use SSH to control your Pi from a laptop, so you won't need an external monitor.
* Use VNC so that you can use your Piâ€™s GUI with without carrying a separate monitor.

### Choosing an SD Card

As of this writing, the best micro SD cards for the Pi are Class 10 (indicated by the number `10` surrounded by a circle). I've always had success with the SanDisk brand. Other cards might work just as well, but this is the brand that has always performed for me.

Depending on the configuration of your laptop, you might need an adapter to read your card.

### Out Takes
The Raspberry Pi remains at the top of the heap of single-board computers. Other single-board computers may have more cores or more power or a lower price. But the Pi remains on top largely due to the community of support that surrounds the device.
