>Business is not a war to be won, but a puzzle to be solved.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>~Sam Zell

Sam Zell is a Chicago-based investor in real estate and troubled assets. He has a reputation for successful business turnaournds as well as direct & clear communication. Sometimes he ends his verbal messages with a question: “Am I being too subtle?” 

Perfect title for his autobiography.

### Staying Informed

Readers learn about the period prior to Sam's birth when his parents were forced to leave Poland at the beginning of World War II. His parents were multi-lingual and intellectually curious. While many of their relatives and neighbors were content to follow local news, Sam's parents read newspapers from Germany, France, Switzerland, and other nearby countries. Their curiosity about the world around them meant that they were well informed _before_ the fall of Poland. Zell's parents left Poland on the day before German armies marched in. They didn't know it at the time, but Sam's mother was pregnant with him as they journeyed to America.

### Law Firms Wouldn't Hire Sam Zell

After law school (yes, this blog post skips a few years in Sam's life) Zell interviewed for entry-level jobs at several firms. 

Finally, he struck a deal with one firm. Leaders of the firm allowed Sam to do deals out of their office in exchange for the legal work that his deal flow was sure to bring.


### The Value of Partnership

Zell's partner in law school was Bob Lurie (verify name). Lurie's strengths were...


### Investing Against the Herd

>“Knowing the numbers” means having the discipline to listen to them—even if they’re not telling you what you want to hear.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>~Sam Zell


### Avoiding Competition

Like the authors of [Blue Ocean Strategy](/blog/2012/11/10/make-your-competition-irrelevant/), Zell prefers to invest where there is little competition. Bidding wars are expensive.


### Birth of the Grave Dancer

>If we’ve been as successful in real estate as we have been, aren’t we really just good businessmen? And if we’re good businessmen, then why wouldn’t the same principles that apply to buying real estate apply to buying anything else?” We checked the boxes—supply and demand, barriers to entry, tax considerations—all of the criteria that governed our decisions in real estate, and didn’t see any differences. So we set a goal that we would diversify our investment portfolio to be 50 percent real estate and 50 percent non–real estate by 1990.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>~Sam Zell

Success in real estate, combined with a shortage of real estate investment opportunities, led Zell to explore other business opportunities. He looked for troubled businesses where he might help. Zell acquired a nickname in his early years: _The Grave Dancer_.


### Devouring Books

With the launch of [Bridgetown Partners](https://bridgetownpartners.com), I find myself devouring books on all aspects of commercial real estate. Articles, too. Topics include syndication, taxation, cash flow analysis, raising private money, and... biography. Well-written biographies are fascinating because you get to explore the subject before they become the fully-formed high-achiever who attracts the attention of a biographer. Zell's autobiography succeeds on this mission.
