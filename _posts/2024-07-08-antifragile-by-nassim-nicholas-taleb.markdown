Fragile objects are easy to break. Drop a glass on a concrete floor, and it will shatter. 

Now, what is the opposite of fragile? Some people might say _robust_. 

However, author Nassim Nicholas Taleb offers a different view. Taleb argues that the opposite of fragile is not robust, but _antifragile_. 

Comparing fragile, robust, and antifragile...
* Fragile objects break when exposed to external stress. 
* Robust objects maintain their form when exposed to external stress.
* Antifragile objects improve when exposed to external stress.

Why does a business leader care about antifragility?

### One Antifragile Example: Fire

Fire can be fragile or antifragile, depending on the size of the flame. For example, light a single match and you can easily blow it out with one puff of breath. 

But if you blow on a larger flame, like a campfire, that flame is not easy to extinguish. In fact, those of us with camping experience know that blowing on a campfire will make the flames hotter.

A single match is fragile, while a campfire is antifragile. 

### Antifragility Helps Us to Understand Fragility

When we understand antifragility, we learn more about fragility, and can help us to improve our risk management skills.


### We Can Measure Fragility, But Not Risk

For example, the recent global pandemic sent shock-waves thrugh the global financial system (RTH,say this better w/o focusing on money.)

When we know how & why a system improves (or fails) under stress, we can design the system to avoid failure.

Here's the author's test for measuring fragility. 

* Anything that has more upside than downside from random events (or certain shocks) is antifragile. 
* Anything wiht more downside is fragile.

For example, our bodies are antifragile system. Our bones and muscles need a certain degree of physical exercise in order to grow stronger. Otherwise, our muscles  will atrophy and we will die. Our immunie systems need exposure to certain pathgens in order to develop antibodies so that we can battle against illness. A football team that battles against tougher opponents week after week will, in the long run, grow stronger over time. 

One interesting attribute of antifragile systems: They get weaker when deprived of randomness or valatility. A football team that only plays weaker opponents will eventually drop in skill, and they will find themselves ill-equipped to face a well-prepared adversary. 

We humans are antifragile systems. We need to battle against opposition, randomness, and volatility in order to become our best.

### Antifragile Defined

In his book Antifragile, author Nassim Nicholas Taleb shares insights about the nature of systems. Fragile systems fail easily. A crystal chandelier will break if itâ€™s mishandled. Taleb observed that some systems benefit from mis-handling & chaos. 



### Antifragile, Defined

We begin with a definition by example. 

A single burning match is fragile. But if you build a robust-enough campfire, that campfire will be antifragile.
