Fragile objects are easy to break. Drop a glass on a concrete floor, and it will shatter. 

Now, what is the opposite of fragile? Some people might say _robust_. 

However, author Nassim Nicholas Taleb offers a different answer. Taleb argues that the opposite of fragile is not robust, but _antifragile_. 

### One Antifragile Example

Fire can be fragile or antifragile, depending on the size of the flame. For example, light a single match and you can easily blow it out with one puff of breath. 

But if you blow on a larger flame, like a campfire, that flame is not easy to extinguish. In fact, those of us with camping experience know that blowing on a campfire will make the flames hotter.

A single match is fragile, while a campfire is antifragile. 

Why does a business leader care about antifragility?

### Antifragile Defined

In his book Antifragile, author Nassim Nicholas Taleb shares insights about the nature of systems. Fragile systems fail easily. A crystal chandelier will break if itâ€™s mishandled. Taleb observed that some systems benefit from mis-handling & chaos. 



### Antifragile, Defined

We begin with a definition by example. 

A single burning match is fragile. But if you build a robust-enough campfire, that campfire will be antifragile.
