One thing I admire about the book [Traction](/blog/2021/02/15/traction-entrepreneurial-operating-system-eos/): The author borrows business concepts from other books, while giving generous credit to each source. For example:

* The idea of getting the right people in the right seats comes from [Good to Great](/blog/2015/05/22/building-a-great-company/) by Jim Collins. 
* Organizing a business around three key components (finance, marketing, and operations) comes from Michael Gerber's [E-Myth Revisited](https://www.emyth.com/).

Traction and the Entrepreneurial Operating System add value by molding these concepts into useful tools. This post focuses on tools that leaders need when interacting with people.

This article is part of a series on [Traction and the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS)](/blog/2021/02/15/traction-entrepreneurial-operating-system-eos/). EOS is a set of tools that enables a business leader to grow a company while maintaining sanity. Today's EOS component: People.


### Next in the Series: Data

> Without the data, yo chatta don't matta.

Next EOS topic: Data. Running a business without data is like driving a car without a dashboard. You can run it that way for awhile, but we need to know that we have enough fuel before we take the next road trip.

# Out-Takes

### Implementation

Implementing EOS is a lot like preparing a meal for your extended family. The kitchen is a mess, everything feels chaotic during the prep and cooling process. And when you finally sit down to eat, the meal is delicious. 

In order to enjoy the meal, we’ve got to make it through the chaos of cooking and prepping. 

Dealing with people can be chaotic. Then People Component of EOS strives to make people-management less chaotic.

First, we don’t manage people. We lead people. 

### Core Value Fit
It's not about right/wrong or good vs bad. It's about what fits the company. What is the correct shoe size? The one that fits your foot.

### Leadership Dropping the Ball
It's very easy for the leadership team to drop the ball on evaluations. To base evaluations on subjective measurements.

### Where Leadership Drops the Ball


Don't do "double secret probation" like the college dean in the movie "Animal House".
