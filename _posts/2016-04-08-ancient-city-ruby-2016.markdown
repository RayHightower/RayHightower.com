[Hashrocket](http://hashrocket.com) launched [Ancient City Ruby](http://www.ancientcityruby.com/) in 2013 and the conference has grown ever since. Participants come from around the world: Some to speak, some to learn, some to pair-program with the Hashrocket team for days (or weeks) after the conference.
 
I am grateful to the organizers for inviting me to present _Get Started With Parallel Programming Featuring Parallella_ this year.

### Getting Started (with gotchas)

If you own a Pine64 or Parallella (or if you are planning to own them) the following posts provide info on getting the devices up and running:

* [Pine64 Quick Start Guide (with Gotchas)](/blog/2016/04/04/pine64-quick-start-guide-using-mac-os-x/)

* [Parallella Quick Start Guide (with Gotchas)](/blog/2014/07/07/parallella-quick-start-guide-with-gotchas/)

Each post includes _gotchas that got me so that they don't get you._ Continuous improvement is the goal, so your feedback is welcome and encouraged.
