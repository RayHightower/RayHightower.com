Excel spreadsheets are ok for quick analysis, but when the rows are too many and the formulas are too complex, recalc time slows to a crawl. Plus, sharing a spreadsheet is cumbersome due to security and version control headaches.

This presentation will take the audience through a conversion from an old, slow spreadsheet into a zippy Ruby on Rails app.
