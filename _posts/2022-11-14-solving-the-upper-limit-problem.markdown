What is stopping you from operating in your Zone of Genius? In his book _The Big Leap_, author Gay Hendricks identifies "The Upper Limit Problem" as the one obstacle blocking a person from achieving greatness. Hendricks divides human performce into four zones. His findings inspired me to create this graphic:

The Upper Limit Problem can keep a person stuck on the three lower performance levels, never to achieve genius. 

Now that we've defined the problem, how can high achievers break through and achieve their potential?

### Clarity from Youth

Hendricks holds a PhD in psychology and he has studied human behavior for decades. He openly discusses his observations with his family, including the youngest members. His 12-year-old granddaughter explains the upper limit problem in these words:

>If you don’t know it’s OK to feel good and have a good time, you’ll do something to mess up when things are going well.

One could say that the upper limit problem is a form of self-sabotage. 

### Internal Thermostat

Hendricks has observed that we humans are equipped with an internal "thermostat" that sets an upper limit on our performance. When we achieve more than we believe we deserve, we engage in self-sabotage, thereby pulling our performance back down to the "acceptable" level set by the thermostat. The thermostat controls our performance. 

For most of us, the thermostat level was set in early childhood, before we learned think for ourselves. Parents, teachers, kids on the schoolyard, authority figures, peers... all have a role in setting our early thermostat.

Fortunately, once we know that the thermostat exists, we can take action.

### Humanity's Upper Limit

Once Hendricks discovered the upper limit problem patter, he began to see its manifestations everywhere. For example:

* Humans enjoy a period of peace and then plunge into a war.
* Humans create a time of econoimic expansion, then we go into a recession or depression.

It appears that collectively, as a species, we have a lmiited tolerance for feeling good. We do something to mess it up.

### Why We Have an Upper Limit

>Many of our fears are based on the workings of the ego, the part of us that's focused on getting recognition and protecing us from social ostracism.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>~From _The Big Leap_

Along the path to solving the Upper Limit Problem, one might ask the question, "Why do we have an Upper Limit Problem, and how does it serve us?"

Of all the living creatures on Planet Earth, humans are not the fastest or the strongest. But we are the best at communicating with each other, and we're the best at working together in groups. Group dynamics are at the core of our nature. 


### Managing the Thermostat

Humans are not mechanical. If we were, it would be possible to dial the thermostat to the desired level and be done. Knowing that the thermostat exists means that we must now take responsibility for managing it.

Hendricks offers some ideas for managing the thermostat. Here's one...


This is not a once-and-done solution. We will find ourselves resetting the thermostat every time we encounter an upper limit problem. Here's how.








### Conclusion + Next Steps

One final point. The author observes that the more a person achieves, the more urgent it is for them to identify and overcome their Upper Limit Problem. One is reminded of the line from the _Spiderman_ movies: When we have great power, we also have great responsibility.
