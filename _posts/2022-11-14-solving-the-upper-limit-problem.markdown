Is something blocking you from operating in your Zone of Genius? In his book _The Big Leap_, author Gay Hendricks identifies "The Upper Limit Problem" as the one obstacle blocking a person from achieving greatness. Expressed grapically:

Now that we've defined the problem, how can high achievers break through?

### Clarity from Youth

Hendricks has researched human behavior for decades. He shares his research with his family, including the youngest members. His 12-year-old granddaughter explains the upper limit problem in these words:

>If you don’t know it’s OK to feel good and have a good time, you’ll do something to mess up when things are going well.

One could say that the upper limit problem is a form of self-sabotage. 

### Internal Thermostat

Hendricks has observed that we humans are equipped with an internal "thermostat" that sets an upper limit on our performance. When we achieve more than we believe we deserve, we engage in self-sabotage, thereby pulling our performance back down to the "acceptable" level set by the thermostat. The thermostat controls our performance. 

For most of us, the thermostat is set in early childhood, before we've learned think for ourselves. Fortunately, now that we know that the ULP exists, we can reset the thermostat and break through the ULP.

### Zones of Performance

Hendricks defines four zones of performance.

* Incompetence
* Competence
* Excellence
* Genius

When we try something for the first time, it's natural to fall into the Zone of Incompetence. With practice and mentorship, we can move into the Zone of Competence and eventually into the Zone of Excellence.

Many people live out their lives in these middle two zones. In fact, all of us perform daily tasks where competence or excellence are fine. Examples: Driving a car, cooking daily meals, managing a personal budget.

Making The Big Leap into the Zone of Genius requires more.


### Solving the Problem

* In order to achieve, we need to break through the Upper Limit Problem and operate in our Zone of Genius.
* In order to break through the Upper Limit Problem, we need to change the performance thermostat.
* Fortunately, the thermostat is something we can control.
* This book tells how to control the thermostat.

### How Was the Thermostat Set in the First Place?

I know a therapist who says "nobody gets through life without scars". 




### Conclusiong + Next Steps

Hendricks observes that the more a person achieves, the more urgent it is for them to identify and overcome their Upper Limit Problem.
