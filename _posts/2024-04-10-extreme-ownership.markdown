### What is Extreme Ownership?

What is Extreme Ownership and why does it matter to a business leader?

_Extreme Ownership_ is a mindset practiced by the authors of the book by that name. Jocko Willink and Leif Babin served our country as [Navy SEALs](https://www.navy.com/careers-benefits/careers/special-operations/navy-seal?q=seals), elite warriors of the United States Navy.

From the book's introduction:
>With Extreme Ownership, you must remove individual ego and personal agenda. It's all about the mission. How can you best get your team to most effectively execute the plan in order to accomplish the mission? That is the question you have to ask yourself. That is what Extreme Ownership is all about.

This post offers a one-page discussion about the book.

### People, Not Robots

Those of us who have not served in the military (including me) may be led to believe that military leaders have it easy because subordinates must follow orders blindly. Not true. U.S. Military Personnel are not robots. When a person chooses to enter the profession of arms, they are _literally_ risking their lives for the mission. A person who accepts that level of risk must believe in the mission. That belief is communicated through effective leadership.

The book _Extreme Ownership_ pulls the reader into the theatre of war where battlefield challenges are described. Leadership principles are extracted from each battlefield situation. And then each principle is applied to business. This framework is repeated throughout the book:

* Battlefield Experience
* Principle
* Application to Business


### Death by Powerpoint

Before reading _Extreme Ownership_, I did not know that military briefings were conducted via Microsoft PowerPoint. It makes sense. PowerPoint is an effective communication tool. 

At the same time, the book describes cases where military units were bogged down creating PowerPoint slides to satisfy bureaucrats. The same scenario happens in the business world! One evening at the combat operations post, the SEAL team was engaged in a PowerPoint marathon. They realized that the PowerPoint briefing document was getting in the way of mission execution. 

So they cut the number of slides and simplified the briefing by focusing on one principle. It's less important for the brass to have every mission detail. And it is more important for the military personnel on the ground (SEALs, Sailors, Marines, and Soldiers) to know their role and how to contribute to the overall mission.

Leaders can teams are more effective when everyone understands the broader mission objective, expressed as Commander's Intent.

### Commander's Intent

It has been said that the first casualty of any war is the battle plan. Why? Because a battle plan, no matter how well thought out, can never consider _every_ contingency.

Military commanders have learned that the Commander's Intent must be communicated as part of any effectie battle plan. Key questions to answer when sharing Commander's Intent with the team: 

* Do the members of the team understand the broader mission?
* Are the members of the team allowed to execute based on their understanding of the broaader mission?
* Does the organization have clearly expressed standard operating procedures?

Running a military unit or business organization based on Commander's Intent takes a lot of up-front planning and training. However, the payoff comes when the organization faces an unexpected obstacle. 

Train the team, communicate the Commander's Intent, and enjoy the results of achievement.

### Front Echelon: From Battlefield to Boardroom

The authors of _Extreme Ownership_ served our country for decades. Upon retirement from the SEAL teams, they decided to share their leadership lessons with the business world. Today they grow business leaders through their leadership development company, [Front Echelon](https://echelonfront.com/).

In addition, author Jocko Willink teamed up with fellow martial artists to launch [Victory MMA and Fitness](https://www.victorygyms.com/) in San Diego, CA.

### Conclusion

Warfare is as old as human history. The best way to discourage an attacker is by being prepared to fight.

Our military units fight on the battlefield. As company leaders, we join with our teams to battle against tough business challenges. The similarities are fascinating.
