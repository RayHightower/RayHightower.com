### Why Jekyll?

As software developers, we have a ton of stuff to learn. Our learning is reinforced when we share our learning with others. Blogging and presenting are two ways to share knowledge with our colleagues.

Jekyll is a static HTML page generator. Jekyll includes tools that accelerate the blogging process, especially for people who know Ruby, because Jekyll is written Ruby.

### Why Not CMS?

So why not use a content management system (CMS) like Wordpress? There's nothing wrong with Wordpress. But CMS-generated pages will always be served slower because of the calls to the database. But static HTML pages are just sitting on the storage device, ready to be propelled across the internet as requested.

Sometimes you want a CMS. Other times, you need the speed of statically generated pages. It all depends on the objective of the project.

### 15 Minutes of Slides

Every hack night starts with 10 to 15 minutes of introduction, followed by two hours of hands-on-the-keyboard hacking. This set of slides is designed for quick review.
