Over 5,000 tech enthusiasts attended the [All Things Open](http://allthingsopen.org) conference in Raleigh, NC this week. The topics were rich: AI, IoT, devops, UXD, developer tools, burn-out, technical leadership... what an eclectic collection to choose from!

The organizers invited me to present [Raspberry Pi is a Gateway Drug for GPUs](https://twitter.com/AllThingsOpen/status/1178751365264429059). Slides from the talk appear below...

Questions from the audience reflected their varied backgrounds: developers, designers, entrepreneurs, and general open source hardware enthusiasts. Learning happens when ideas are freely exchanged by groups like this.

Thank you to the AllThingsOpen organizers for having me on stage this year!
