>Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you want to come with me and change the world?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~Steve Jobs

Steve Jobs posed the above question to an executive at Pepsi while recruiting him to join Apple. That was in the 1980s. You already know the history of Apple after that. 

[Bridgetown Partners](https://bridgetownpartners.com) is hiring a Community Manager (CM) to help with the growth of our events and publications. This is a part-time, independent contractor position, mostly remote, with some on-site work (in Los Angeles) for meetings and events. The position could evolve into full-time depending on the growth of the community and the performance of the CM.

Every member of the Bridgetown Partners team is helping to improve the world. The community manager will be one of the drivers of improvement.
