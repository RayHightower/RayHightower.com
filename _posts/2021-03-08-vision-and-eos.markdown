This article is part of a series on [Traction and the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS)](/blog/2021/02/15/traction-entrepreneurial-operating-system-eos/). EOS is a set of tools that enables a business leader to grow a company while maintaining sanity. Today's EOS component: Vision.

Most entrepreneurs can see their vision clearly. Problems arise if they assume that everyone else in the organization can see it, too. But humans are not mind-readers. We can only see the vision of another person if that vision is communicated clearly and with intention. EOS solves the vision problem with the Vision/Traction Organizer (V/TO). You can download a copy of the V/TO at [EOSWorldwide.com/VTO](http://EOSWorldwide.com/vto). 

Let's explore.

### Decide on the Vision

EOS suggests that business leaders can clarify their vision by answering eight questions. After that, leaders can communicate the vision via the 2-page V/TO. 

The eight questions are...

1. **What are your core values?**

2. **What is your core focus?**

3. **What is your ten-year target?**

4. **What is your marketing strategy?**

5. **What is your three-year picture?**

6. **What is your one-year plan?**

7. **What are your issues?**

### One Example: Core Values

As defined in the book _Traction_, core values are a small set of vital and timeless guiding principles for a company. Here are the core values for Bridgetown Partners:

* **Collaboration**. Our leadership team learned long ago that we can achieve more by collaborating internally (between members of our team) and externally (with our clients and vendors). In every interaction, we seek to achieve win/win arrangements where all parties would welcome the chance to do business again.
* **Profit**. Bridgetown is a business. Therefore we must generate a profit. Profits are healthy and positive when we adhere to our other Core Values: Collaboration and Community Service.
* **Community Service**. Members of Bridgetown Partners give back to the communities where we live and conduct business. Scouting, adult literacy, martial arts, and job training are a few of the areas where our team members contribute to the community.

Great companies can differ in their values. The key is to have consistent values that are good for the long-term health of the company and its clients.

### Communicate the Vision

After the leadership team has chosen a vision (guided by the eight questions), it's time to use the V/TO  communicate the vision throughout the organization. Simpler is better, that's why the VTO is only two pages long.

### Next in the Series: People

Our next post will cover people. We'll discuss how to choose the right people, and how to create an environment where members of the team can thrive while helping the organization to grow.
