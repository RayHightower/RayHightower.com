Entrepreneurs are hard workers.<br/>
But hard work is only one requirement for success.<br/>

<!--more-->

Do we apply our hard work at the right time?<br/>
Do we harvest the crops when the fruit is ripe to be plucked?<br/>
Do we swing when the baseball is in the strike zone?<br/>
Do we Strike While the IRON is HOT?<br/>

Many operators have left the market, for various reasons.<br/>
Leaving lots of opportunities for those of us who remain.<br/>
The iron is HOT.<br/>
Are you ready to strike?<br/>
When was the last time YOU took a STRIKE at the IRON?<br/>
