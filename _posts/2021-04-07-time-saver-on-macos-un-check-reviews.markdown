Does macOS ask you to review software at inconvenient times, like when you're scrambling to meet a deadline? Here's how to stop the request from popping up.

<a href="/blog/2021/04/07/time-saver-on-macos-un-check-reviews/"><img src="/images/macos_microsoft_review_request.png" width="500" padding="10" alt="macOS Microsoft Review Request" title="macOS Microsoft Review Request" /></a>

Open the App Store, go into "Preferences", and uncheck "In-App Ratings & Reviews". No more requests for reviews.

This technique works as of the date of this post. Will macOS change in the future? Probably!
