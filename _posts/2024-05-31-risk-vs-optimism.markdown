Given the fact that investing is risky, we have two choices:

* We can run away from risk. Of course, the problem with running away is that we cut ourselves from potential upside.

* We can evaluate the risk rationally. And decide (using business creativity) how to take steps that will mitigate the risks.

If you're driving down a road and you see a pothole, you can turn around and avoid the road altogether. Or, if you're a skillful driver, you can navigate around the pothole and minimize the impact on your journey.

Which path do you prefer?
