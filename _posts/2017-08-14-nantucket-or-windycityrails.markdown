>There once was a dev from Nantucket,<br/>
Who tried to write code in a bucket.<br/>
“It works” quoth the coder.<br/>
Now I want to get bolder.<br/>
I’m ready for [WindyCityRails](http://windycityrails.com).<br/>

You’re right. That limerick is only 80% complete.

<!--more-->

Still, you should go to [WindyCityRails](http://windycityrails.com). The speakers are outstanding. And the opportunity to network with your fellow software professionals is something that cannot be passed up.

And here's a bonus for you. Use the discount code `8THLIGHT` for $50 off of the standard conference fee.

See you in September!
