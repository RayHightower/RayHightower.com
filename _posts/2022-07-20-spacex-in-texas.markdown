The above photo shows the SpaceX facility in Boca Chica, Texas. While walking the grounds, I was reminded of a question my mother asked me. "Raymond, do you want to go to space?"

My response: "Yes."

### Conditions for Space Travel

Of course, my "yes" comes with conditions:

- I won't go first. My space vehicle must be successfully tested by other humans before I hop on board.
- I will go with a team. My biggest triumphs in life have come as part of a cohesive team.
- I will have a role that fits my skills and strengths.
- The team and I will have a solid plan for departure and return. I still have family and friends here on Planet Earth, and I enjoy their company.
- Our team will rehearse the plan over & over.
- As we rehearse the plan for departure & return, our team will learn from our mistakes and continuously improve our skills.

The above conditions will improve our odds of success while reducing failure to a tiny footnote.

### Space Travel and Investing

Investing is similar. Running a business is similar. I've done both for decades.

My team at [Bridgetown Partners](https://BridgetownPartners.com) treats investing with the care and attention of a space mission. For the space mission, the safety of the crew is paramount. For our investors, the safety of your hard-earned capital is paramount. Planning is key. Returning home safely is the driving objective.

Plus, our investment vehicles offer handsome returns and tax benefits. You don't get those in space!
