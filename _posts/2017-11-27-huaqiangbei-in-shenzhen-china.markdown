Huaqiangbei (pronounced hoo-wah-chang-bay) is a place for makers of electronics, robotics, and anything tech-related. This neighborhood within Shenzhen was the primary reason for my visit to China in November 2017.

### Why Shenzhen?

Imagine an IKEA-sized store filled with electronics instead of furniture. Not just cell phones and laptops, but the parts we use to build our digital devices: solid state components, ICs, circuit boards, and all the tools needed for assembly and repair. Double the size of the store in your mind. And then fill a neighborhood with buildings just like it. That’s Huaqiangbei.

### Shenzhen in One Hour

Wired Magazine published a [1-hour video about Shenzhen and Huaquiangbei](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGJ5cZnoodY&list=PLOnWKC1gI_OMDuVNC0l27FZ2xJUX5UTkg&index=7) in July 2016.

Key points from the video:

* Twenty years ago, Shenzhen was a tiny 30,000-person fishing villiage. Today, roughly 12 million people call Shenzhen home.
* The government of China created a deliberate plan for Shenzhen's focus on technology. Growth like this does not happen by accident.
* Shenzhen has evolved in a way much bigger and faster than the central planners predicted.
* Moore's Law and the global demand for electonics played a role in the growth of Shenzhen.
* Most vendors at Huaqiangbei prefer to deal in volume.
* Some of the goods sold in Shenzhen are counterfeit. Caveat emptor.
* Shenzhen is not just about marketplaces. There are meetups, startup incubators, and accelerators for entrepreneurs who are ready to collaborate with others and grow.
* Hardware prototypes in Shenzhen can be created in record time. Faster prototyping yields faster iterations and faster learning. In the end, customers get better products.
* Consumer electronics products hit Huaqiangbei a few years before they
make it to the USA.

### Globalization is Good

Another reason why Shenzhen is so exciting: Globalization is good.  Opportunities in tech are too large for one nation to play a monopoly role.

The Wired video tells you what to expect once you get to Shenzhen. This post will tell you how to prepare for the trip, along with a few gotchas that I encountered along the way.

### Passports and Visas

US citizens need need a passport and a visa to visit mainland China. As of this writing, it's possible to visit Shenzhen for up to six days without a visa, but a visa is easy to get if you plan ahead. So grab the visa. A service like [Travisa](http://travisa.com) can get you a ten-year multiple entry visa for less than $200.

### Flights and Hotels

[Priceline](http://priceline.com) has consistently given me great deals on flights and hotels all over the world. I used Priceline for my Shenzhen trip, and they delivered well. 

### Managing the Language Barrier

If you already speak Mandarin, you will navigate well in Shenzhen. I am
not fluent in Mandarin, so I relied on a few crutches.

* Google Translate rocks.
* [Chineasy](http://chineasy.com) is an excellent intro to the most frequently used characters in Chinese writing. 

Astute readers will note that Google's tools are blocked by the Great Firewall, and you'll need a VPN to use Google's Translate and Map apps. 

### Visit Hong Kong

If you make it to Shenzhen, try to schedule a trip to Hong Kong as well. The two cities asre only a short train ride apart, like riding from Midtown Manhattan to Brooklyn. US citizens can travel to Hong Kong without a visa, but you'll still need to go through customs.

### First Impressions
I expected to be overwhelmed by Huaqiangbei. And still, I was overwhelmed.

Prototypes paradise. 
Surface mount components on roles of tape, ready to be added to circuit boards by robots.  

Yes, you can find mobile phones and laptops. But more importantly, Huaquiangbei 

Cyclists and motorized bikes todd the sidewalk. What was unsafe okor people at Football game is now sags for me. 

Bikes and motorized bikes blanket the sidewalk. Bikers are afraid to ride in the streets because

### History
30 years ago, Shenzhen was a 300,000-person fishing village. Today, Shenzhen is a modern city of skyscrapers and 15 million people.

### Navigation With Google Maps

The astute reader might ask: How can you navigate with Google Maps in China without using a VPN? How, indeed!

### International

Traveling through China.
Communicating with friends in Kenya about the Kenya-based financial service, M-Pesa via Twitter, a service created in the USA.
Using a financial service based in Panama to add funds to my Chinese-based WeChat account.
Using a VPN created in the USA to ensure secure communications throughout, except when certain services don’t allow VPNs.
Over a VPN running on a virtual server in Hong Kong (verify, RTH!)

### Charging Up WeChat

I used a throw-away number from my credit card company. And I only transferred $50, initially.
Based in Panama???

### WeChat vs M-Pesa

Link to RTH’s M-Pesa article.
WeChat’s coolest features are written in Chinese. M-Pesa’s features are in Swahili, but Swahili is easier to read (say this better, RTH).


### Google Maps
Open streets are closed due to construction 

My brother asked: What surprised you most about Shenzhen?
Answer: That there are so many malls devoted to electronics. HQB is huge!


### Out-Takes

Imagine an IKEA store filled with electronics instead of furniture. Double the size of the store. And then imagine a neighborhood filled with other stores just like it.

Huaquiangbei is a neighborhood in Shenzhen, China filled with stores that sell everything electronic. Sure, you can buy the typical goods: cell phones, laptops, drones, and so on. And IoT enthusiasts are excited to find even more: solid state devices, packaged integrated circuits, Arduinos and Raspberry Pis (and their clones) and even reels of surface-mount components ready for your printed circuit board assembly robot. LEDs of every size, switches of every variety, and non-stop chatter of deals being made.
