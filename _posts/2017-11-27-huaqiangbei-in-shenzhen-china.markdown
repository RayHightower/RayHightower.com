Huaqiangbei (pronounced hoo-WAY-chang-bay) is a place for makers.

Imagine an IKEA-sized store filled with electronics instead of furniture. Not just cell phones and laptops, but the parts we use to build our digital devices: solid state components, ICs, circuit boards, and all the tools needed for assembly and repair. Double the size of the store in your mind. And then fill a neighborhood with buildings just like it. That’s Huaqiangbei, the electronics market in Shenzhen, China.

### One Hour Video

Huaquiangbei was the primary reason for my visit to China. Wired Magazine published a [1-hour video about Shenzhen and Huaquiangbei](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGJ5cZnoodY&list=PLOnWKC1gI_OMDuVNC0l27FZ2xJUX5UTkg&index=7).

### First Impressions

Overwhelmed.
Imagine an IKEA store, only the store is filled with electronics instead of furniture. Double the size of the store. And then imagine a neighborhood filled with other stores just like it.

I expected to be overwhelmed by Huaqiangbei. And still, I was overwhelmed.

Prototypes paradise. 
Surface mount components on roles of tape, ready to be added to circuit boards by robots.  

Yes, you can find mobile phones and laptops. But more importantly, Huaquiangbei 

Cyclists and motorized bikes todd the sidewalk. What was unsafe okor people at Football game is now sags for me. 

Bikes and motorized bikes blanket the sidewalk. Bikers are afraid to ride in the streets because

### History
30 years ago, Shenzhen was a 300,000-person fishing village. Today, Shenzhen is a modern city of skyscrapers and 15 million people.

### Navigation With Google Maps

The astute reader might ask: How can you navigate with Google Maps in China without using a VPN? How, indeed!

### International

Traveling through China.
Communicating with friends in Kenya about the Kenya-based financial service, M-Pesa via Twitter, a service created in the USA.
Using a financial service based in Panama to add funds to my Chinese-based WeChat account.
Using a VPN created in the USA to ensure secure communications throughout, except when certain services don’t allow VPNs.
Over a VPN running on a virtual server in Hong Kong (verify, RTH!)

### Charging Up WeChat

I used a throw-away number from my credit card company. And I only transferred $50, initially.
Based in Panama???

### WeChat vs M-Pesa

Link to RTH’s M-Pesa article.
WeChat’s coolest features are written in Chinese. M-Pesa’s features are in Swahili, but Swahili is easier to read (say this better, RTH).

Open streets are closed due to construction 

My brother asked: What surprised you most about Shenzhen?
Answer: That there are so many malls devoted to electronics. HQB is huge!


### Out-Takes

Imagine an IKEA store filled with electronics instead of furniture. Double the size of the store. And then imagine a neighborhood filled with other stores just like it.

Huaquiangbei is a neighborhood in Shenzhen, China filled with stores that sell everything electronic. Sure, you can buy the typical goods: cell phones, laptops, drones, and so on. And IoT enthusiasts are excited to find even more: solid state devices, packaged integrated circuits, Arduinos and Raspberry Pis (and their clones) and even reels of surface-mount components ready for your printed circuit board assembly robot. LEDs of every size, switches of every variety, and non-stop chatter of deals being made.
