### Conclusions

You have to do the work. Don't think that reading this book will fix yoru company.
Metaphor: It's like going to the doctor but not taking the medicine.
Quarterly meetings are essential. If you take your foot off the gas pedal, you won't come to a screeching halt, but you will coast and eventually stop.

If you don't know what to do, sit with a blank legal pad and a pen.

If you're getting distracted by shiny stuff, choose one discipline and stick with it.
