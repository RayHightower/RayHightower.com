[Ignite Chicago](http://ignitechi.org) is an evening of 5-minute talks presented by speakers who want to inspire others. Each speaker is allowed twenty slides, and the slides advance automatically every fifteen seconds. The Ignite organizers asked me to present _Why We Need STEM_ at [1871](http://1871.com). I'll post the video when it becomes available. For now, check out the slides...

Thank you Ignite Chicago organizers ([Pete Aiello](http://www.goteampete.com) and [Claire Lew](http://clairelew.com)) for the invitation and for hosting a great event.
