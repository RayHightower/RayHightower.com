I can't claim to have the "correct" answer, but I can offer some experiences.

My team and I got to know each others' strengths and weaknesses by sifting, reviewing, underwriting, and making offers on deals over eighteen months. Let me clarify: We spent eighteen months doing all of that before we closed our first deal together.

There are three of us on our core team. We had a few more in the beginning. We all remain friends, but our core three were compatible in terms of work ethic and desire to achieve. Plus we have complimentary skills. One person is strong on UW. Another has great banking and legal relationships. Another manages most of our investor relations & communications.

We evolved into our roles over time. With each iteration (tour, evaluation, offer, and _finally_ closing) we got to know and trust each other.

All of us have been on partnership teams before. All of us have positive and negative experiences to reflect upon.
One key trait: We're not afraid to tell each other the truth. Even when it's uncomfortable. Of course, we always tell the truth with respect. We argue and debate (just like siblings) but we've built up enough trust that it doesn't get personal.

Now that we've closed our first deal together (94u, $13.6M acquisition, $6.5M raise) we're in the middle of asset management. And we are facing a whole new set of challenges. Fortunately, the trust that we built during the acquisition phase carries over.

How did we build our team of advisors? Relationships plus trial & error. Some early professionals did not work out. Others are working in amazing ways. We watch everything and we try to learn from our mistakes.

Bottom line: Trustworthy people tend to be magnets for other trustworthy people. And even if you have trust, sometimes things don't work out due to compatibility issues. Or timing. Or where each person is within their personal life journey. So many variables!

Hope this helps. Glad to talk further if you want to dig into this.
