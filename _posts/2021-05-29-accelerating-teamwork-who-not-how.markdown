The Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS) as described in the book [Traction](/blog/2021/02/15/traction-entrepreneurial-operating-system-eos/) consists of six components. The second component, [People](/blog/2021/04/08/people-and-eos/), focuses on attracting the right people to the team and putting them in the right positions within the organization.

While exploring the people-component within Bridgetown Partners, I was introduced to a book that explores people and organizations in depth: _Who Not How_ by Dan Sullivan and Dr. Benjamin Hardy.
