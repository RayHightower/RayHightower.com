The Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS) as described in the book [Traction](/blog/2021/02/15/traction-entrepreneurial-operating-system-eos/) consists of six components. The second component, [People](/blog/2021/04/08/people-and-eos/), focuses on attracting the right people to the team and putting them in the right positions within the organization.

While exploring the people-component within Bridgetown Partners, I was introduced to a book that explores people and organizations in depth: _Who Not How_ by Dan Sullivan and Dr. Benjamin Hardy.

### On the Court

>If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go with others.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>- African Proverb

A well-trained individual can accomplish much. At the same time, a team of individuals, working in concert as a team, can achieve more.

The authors of _Who Not How_ enjoy sports history. For example, they cite Michael Jordan's early years with the Chicago Bulls. Jordan was a strong player, perhaps the best player, throughout his professional career. But in order to win championships, he needed to be teamed with Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Phil Jackson, and Tim Grover. Pippen, Rodman, Jackson, and Grover were the _Whos_ who enabled Jordan to blossom into a brilliant  player. 

### Off the Court

Note that the last two, Jackson and Grover, never joined Jordan on the court. Jackson was the coach who knew how to pull the team together and design plays that leveraged the strengths of every player. Grover was the high-performance trainer hired by Jordan for a 30-day regimen. Grover performed so well that Jordan engaged him for the next fifteen years.

Yes, it is important for us to hone our individual skills. To know _How_ to execute. And by leveraging the _Whos_ around us, we can achieve more. 

How many of us try to perform (the _How_) like Michael Jordan without the team (the _Whos_)?

### Create Value First

When seeking a _Who_ to help achieve a goal, we must ensure that they get value out of the goal, too. We already know "What's in it for me?" It's more important for us to understand "What's in it for them?"

In the above sports example, Jordan wanted to win championships. Same for Rodman and Pippen. Jackson is driven by the opportunity to build teams. Grover, as described in his book _Relentless_, is fulfilled by the chance to improve the performance of the greatest athletes on the planet.

Goals are aligned for every person in the Bulls example.

### Be a _Who_ for Others

Further, in the Bulls example: Each member of the team was a _Who_ for the other members of the team. One effective way to find a _Who_ for our missions is to be a _Who_ for others with a compatible mission.


### Conclusion

>If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the people to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>― Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

Well said, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.
