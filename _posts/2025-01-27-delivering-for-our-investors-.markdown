The above photo shows Colby Fryar, Adrian Diaz, and me after a recent property tour.

After walking through a property, we like to put our heads together and compare notes. Questions for discussion:

* Is this property a good fit for our buy-box?
* If we buy this one, will we make money for our investors?

Every deal we choose must deliver the following for our investors:

* Capital Preservation
* Tax Advantages
* Solid ROI

What a joy to deliver for our investors!
