Whenever I witness business executing well, I ask myself one question: “How can I apply this lesson to Bridgetown Partners?" 

Recent experience: Restoration Hardware.

You may know [Restoration Hardware](https://rh.com) as a seller of high end home furnishings with locations in affluent areas around the USA. Yesterday I learned that they have a restaurant in the middle of their Nashville store. 

“Brilliant idea,” I said to the two hostesses. “How long have you had the restaurants in the store.”

“About five years,” one hostess replied. “It was all my idea,” replied the other. And we all laughed together. 

“We also have a walk-up bar, so if you’d like to grab a coffee or glass of wine while you browse around, you’re welcome to it.” 

Brilliant idea. 

Any customer spending RH-level prices for home furnishings will want to take time to think about the purchase. Humans tend to have positive thoughts when the belly is full. 

Every time I run across a good idea being implemented in a business I admire, I ask myself: How can I do something similar in my businesses?

Steve Jobs is famous for repeating this quote from Picasso: “Good artists copy. Great artists steal.”
