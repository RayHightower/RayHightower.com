It's possible to read the book [The Coffee Bean](https://www.amazon.com/Coffee-Bean-Simple-Lesson-Positive-ebook/dp/B07TPS2PDZ/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1683043373&sr=8-1) in less than an hour. The second time you read it, it's better to go slower while savoring the lessons and journaling along the way.
