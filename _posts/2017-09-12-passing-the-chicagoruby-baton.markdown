### New Leadership

After ten years as lead organizer of ChicagoRuby, I have decided to step down. My [8th Light](http://8thlight.com) colleague, [Nicole Carpenter](https://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRuby/members/190520517/), has accepted the leadership baton. Congratulations, Nicole!

### About Nicole Carpenter

Nicole is a software developer with strong leadership and organizational skills. In addition to solving hard problems for clients, she runs the ChicagoRuby hack nights and [8th Light University](https://www.meetup.com/8th-light-university/). She was my first choice to take over the group.

### History of Growth

ChicagoRuby had 78 members when I assumed leadership in 2007. Since then, we have:

* Grown to 4,200+ members.
* Built a leadership team of 16 organizers.
* Created several successful conferences, including, [WindyCityRails](http://windycityrails.com), now in its tenth year.
* Merged with another Ruby group, Chirb (in 2009).
* Hosted meetings and conferences across Chicagoland: North Shore, South Shore, Western 'burbs, and all over Downtown.
* Collaborated with tech enthusiasts in the Caribbean to launch [LinuxBarbados](http://linuxbarbados.org).
* Joined forces with colleagues in the Python and Java communities to launch the [Chicago Polyglot Mingle](http://chicagopolyglot.com).
* Published a blog post on how we get things done: [How to Grow a User Group](/blog/2014/05/30/how-to-grow-a-user-group/).

Yes, our name is ChicagoRuby. But we've never limited ourselves by language or geography!

### Thank You

Leading ChicagoRuby has been a wonderful adventure. To those of you who are members of ChicagoRuby: Thank you for the opportunity to serve.

### By the way...
