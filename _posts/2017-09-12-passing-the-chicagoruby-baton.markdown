After ten years as lead organizer of ChicagoRuby, I have decided to pass the baton. My 8th Light colleague, Nicole Carpenter, has accepted the baton. Congratulations, Nicole!

Nicole is a software developer with strong leadership and organizational skills. In addition to solving hard problems for clients, she runs the ChicagoRuby hack nights and 8th Light University. She was my first choice to take over the group.

ChicagoRuby had 78 members when I assumed leadership in 2007. Since then, we have:

* Grown to 4,200+ members.
* Expanded the organizer team to 16 members.
* Created several successful conferences, including, WindyCityRails, now in its tenth year.
* Merged with another Ruby group, Chirb (in 2009).
* Hosted meetings and conferences across Chicagoland: North Shore, South Shore, Western 'burbs, and all over Downtown.
* Collaborated with tech enthusiasts in the Caribbean to launch LinuxBarbados.
* Joined forces with colleagues in the Python and Java communities to launch the Chicago Polyglot Mingle.

Yes, our name is ChicagoRuby. But we've never allowed ourselves to be limited by language or geography!

Leading ChicagoRuby has been a wonderful adventure. To those of you who are members of ChicagoRuby: Thank you for the opportunity to serve. I look forward to seeing you in and around the community.
