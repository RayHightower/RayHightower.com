[Bridgetown Partners](https://bridgetownpartners.com/) is a buyer of multifamily apartment properties. We buy the properties and we make improvements, thereby giving people a great place to live. Further, we invite investors to benefit from our work. Investors receive preservation of capital, tax advantages, and a solid return on investment.

Early in our history, we considered investing in California. We quickly shifted our focus to Arizona instead. Why?

### Drivers of Investment Decisions

Three main drivers of solid investment decisions:

* **Job Growth**. Do local employers need more people in order to achieve their business goals? Are new employers moving into the area, and are they hiring new people?
* **Income Growth**. Are employees advancing in their careers, adding value to their employer's business, and therefore earning higher salaries and wages?
* **Population Growth**. Do people want to move to the area? Are they moving to enjoy better jobs, a better enivronment, or both?

When our team sees these factors on the upswing, we know that we're in an area of opportunity.

### Other States

In our research, we have uncovered other parts of the country with strong growth in jobs, income, and population. Bridgetown is currently targeting these markets:

* Arizona (Phoenix, Tucson, Sierra Vista)
* Tennessee (Nashville MSA)
* Texas (Cameron County, especially areas close to Brownsville and Boca Chica)
