After ten years as lead organizer of ChicagoRuby, I have decided to step down. My [8th Light](http://8thlight.com) colleague, [Nicole Carpenter](https://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRuby/members/190520517/), has accepted the leadership baton. Congratulations, Nicole!

### About Nicole Carpenter

Nicole is a software developer with strong leadership and organizational skills. In addition to solving hard problems for clients, she runs the ChicagoRuby hack nights and [8th Light University](https://www.meetup.com/8th-light-university/). She was my first choice to take over the group.

### History of Achievement

ChicagoRuby had 78 members when I assumed leadership in 2007. Since then, we have:

* Grown the group to 4,200+ members.
* Built a leadership team of 16 organizers.
* Created several successful conferences, including [WindyCityRails](http://windycityrails.com), now in its tenth year.
* Merged with another Ruby group, Chirb (in 2009).
* Hosted meetings and conferences across Chicagoland: North Shore, South Shore, Western 'burbs, and all over Downtown.
* Collaborated with tech enthusiasts in the Caribbean to launch [LinuxBarbados](http://linuxbarbados.org) (2014).
* Joined forces with colleagues in the Python and Java communities to launch the [Chicago Polyglot Mingle](http://chicagopolyglot.com) (2016 and 2017).
* Published a blog post on how we get things done: [How to Grow a User Group](/blog/2014/05/30/how-to-grow-a-user-group/).

Yes, our name is ChicagoRuby. But we have never limited ourselves by language or geography.

### Thank You

Leading ChicagoRuby has been a wonderful adventure. For example, I first met members of 8th Light through ChicagoRuby back in 2007. That meeting was the beginning of our collaboration, which ultimately led to [8th Light's acquisition of my company](https://8thlight.com/blog/paul-pagel/2016/09/12/8th-light-acquisition-wisdomgroup.html). Many opportunities have come my way via ChicagoRuby. I will always be grateful.

Moving forward, although my responsibilities at 8th Light weigh heavy, you will see me at ChicagoRuby events from time to time. I will continue to cheer for ChicagoRuby. To my fellow Rubyists: Thank you for the opportunity to serve.

### By the way...

My position at 8th Light: Director of Sales. That's a fancy way to say that I find new clients. If your company (or a company that you know) needs custom software, let's talk. Our teams at 8th Light do a great job of keeping the client informed and in control throughout the software development process. If that approach sounds interesting to you, dash me an email and we'll setup a time to talk. If you're local, we can grab coffee together.
