The need for speed is driving more developers to explore parallelism as a way to improve performance. Parallella offers an inexpensive way to experiment with the new paradigm. 

Groupon's Software Engeineering Team invited me to share some Parallella explorations during [Geekfest](http://www.meetup.com/Geekfest/events/227841182/) this afternoon. Slides from the presentation appear below:

Source code for the WebSockets demo is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/RayHightower/eventmachine-websockets-demo). Additional sample code for Parallella can be found in the [Parallella GitHub repo](http://github.com/parallella).

To Groupon: Thanks for the invitation!
