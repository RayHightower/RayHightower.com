It is very difficult to predict interest rates. I would argue that it is impossible to predict the future of interest rates. So what should investors do in the face of future uncertainty?

### Preparation Beats Prediction

To prepare for interest rate ups & downs, our team underwrites conservatively. We give each deal a healthy buffer to ensure that the deal performs whether rates rise or fall. It's not easy to do this. 

We end up walking away from many deals because they can't handle the rigor of our approach. 

The good news: When we choose a deal this way, we know the deal is solid.
