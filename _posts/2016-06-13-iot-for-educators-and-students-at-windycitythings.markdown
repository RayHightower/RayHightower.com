### What is IoT?

IoT is all about connecting devices to each other via the internet. Enabling devices to talk to each other with minimal human direction. Connectivity enables us to solve problems in better ways. For example, aircraft engines with IoT-equipped sensors can order replacement parts before the engine shows signs of trouble. IoT enables proactive maintenance, which saves lives.

IoT also helps shippers deliver [safer foods and medicines](/blog/2016/03/30/how-to-build-a-successful-iot-company/).
