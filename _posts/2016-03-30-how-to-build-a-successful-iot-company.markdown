The Internet of Things is surrounded by hype. And yet a few companies have figured out how to navigate around the hype into a river of profit. [IoT Chicago](http://www.meetup.com/Internet-of-Things-IoT-Chicago/) recently invited [John Hennessy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/selltheprize), senior vice president with [Locus Traxx](http://www.locustraxx.com/), to tell their IoT success story.

### About Locus Traxx
Locus Traxx launched in 2007 with two guys and one truck. Today the company has 100+ employees and operations around the planet. The team struggled along the path to profit from IoT. And they made it.

### Food Safety
If you live in the USA, food safety is something that happens reliably in the background, like electrical service and (soon) WiFi. We don't normally think of the teams of people working hard so that the rest of us can consistently eat healthy food.

And rarely would we consider the relationship between food and the Internet of Things.

### Finding the Need
Food produced in one part of the country must be transported to customers in another part of the country. This usually happens by truck or train. The right environmental conditions must be maintained throughout the journey or the food will spoil.

### Fulfilling the Need

Location and temperature tracking.

Ensure the freshness of temperature-sensitive shipments.
Food.
Medicine.

### Getting Paid

### Learning More
If you're interested in real-world IoT success, check out [IoT Chicago](http://www.meetup.com/Internet-of-Things-IoT-Chicago/). The group runs multiple events each month. The networking alone is worth it.

You might also consider the [WindyCityThings](http://windycitythings.com) conference coming up in June in Chicago. IoT started off as a collection of toys, but now there are serious people (like Locus Traxx, above) making money from this trend. Master the Internet of Things, and make IoT work for you.
