WisdomGroup is hiring a [web design intern](https://jobs.chicagoruby.org/jobs/100). Our current volume of work requires it. The ideal candidate will share our beliefs about design, summarized as...

>Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works. ~Steve Jobs

Great design is functional and inspiring. Autodesk captures the idea in this ad from several years ago:

Text from the Autodesk ad:
>For every serious challenge facing the world there is someone with a big idea. That big idea needs to be nurtured. It needs to be explored and analyzed in order to bring it to life.

>And design is at the core of that innovation. 

>Our technology gives innovators the ability to see how their ideas perform and behave. To exprience it before it's real.

>There isn't a problem in the world that a great designer can't solve.
