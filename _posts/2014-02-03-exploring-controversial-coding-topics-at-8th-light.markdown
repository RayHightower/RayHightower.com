[8th Light](http://8thlight.com) recently hosted a panel discussion on Controversial Coding Topics. I was honored to share the panel with two technology leaders whom I admire: [Mark Rickmeier](http://twitter.com/markrickmeier) of [Table XI](http://tablexi.com) and [Corey Haines](http://twitter.com/coreyhaines) of [Wavetable](http://wavetable.com). [Rachel Feigenbaum](http://twitter.com/little_fig) of 8th Light organized the event.

###Topics Covered
Some of the topics covered during the discussion:

* Hiring. What do you look for when building a team?
* Establishing team standards.
* Balancing professional time with personal time. Don't work 12-hour
  days!

###Gratitude
Thank you 8th Light for making this happen.
