2016 marked the first year for a very special IoT conference, [WindyCityThings](http://windycitythings.com). Thank you to everyone who made the event so successful, especially:

* Speakers, sponsors, attendees, and organizers who all stepped up to make the conference happen.
* [BLUE1647](http://blue1647.com) for running the IoT Youth Program.
* [David Kinney](dlkinney) and [Amy Kinney](amykinney) for helping with speaker selection and MC-ing.
* [South Shore Cultural Center](https://www.facebook.com/TheSouthShoreCulturalCenter/) for providing a great venue.
* [Ganza Image Productions](http://ganzaimage.com) for summarizing the WindyCityThings experience with a 3-minute video.
