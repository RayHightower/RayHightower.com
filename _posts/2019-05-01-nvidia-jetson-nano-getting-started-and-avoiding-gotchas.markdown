The Nvidia Jetson Nano is a single board computer slightly larger than a Raspberry Pi. This Linux-powered device has 128 GPU cores that support CUDA, the Nvidia library that lets developers write GPU-accelerated code in high level languages. Further, the Nano's $99 price makes GPUs available for some cool hobbyist experiments. When powerful technology becomes available to hobbyists, exciting products (and even industries) can be born.

### Jetson Nano, Up & Running

This article will show the reader how to get started with the Jetson Nano as rapidly as possible. You will be able to:

* Burn an SD card with the appropriate Linux4Tegra image.
* Compile and run the GPU-accelerated demos that come with the image.
* Write, compile, and run a GPU-accelerated program using Nvidia's CUDA library.
* Measure the performance improvement that comes from GPU-accelerated code.
* Save time by avoiding some of the _gotchas_ that got me.

Let's get started!

### Jetson Nano Product Highlights

Here are some Jetson Nano specs at a glance:

* 4 ARM cores + 128 GPU cores.
* Support for CUDA, the Nvidia library that lets you write GPU-accelerated code in high level languages like C, C++, Python, Java, Ruby.
* An array of general purpose input/output (GPIO) pins compatible with the pin configuration of the Raspberry Pi. Theoretically, if you have a robot powered by a Raspberry PI, you can add GPU acceleration by replacing the Pi with a Jetson Nano.
* A camera connector that's compatible with the standard Raspberry Pi camera.
* Operating system: Linux4Tegra, an Ubuntu-based distro customized by Nvidia.
* Price: $99.

### What is CUDA? Why does CUDA exist?

CUDA stands for Compute Unified Device Architecture. In the early days of GPU-accelerated computing, deveopers would need to study _how_ graphics acceleration works in order to adapt non-graphics problems to GPUs. CUDA adds a layer of abstraction so that you can write software for GPUs without studying the principles of computer graphics.

Nvidia created CUDA, so CUDA only runs on GPU products from Nvidia.

### Shut Up and Take My Money

The price/performance ratio of this device was so compelling that I tried to buy one while the product was still being announced on the [GTC stage](/blog/2019/03/28/nvidia-gpu-technology-conference-2019/). A true "shut up and take my money" moment.


roughly the size of features four ARM cores and 128 GPU cores. Makers of the board are on a mission to bring AI to everyone.

The Nvidia Jetson Nano is a full Linux computer, as shown in the above screenshot.

### Gotcha: WiFi Not Included

It was surprising to learn that the Jetson Nano did not come with
built-in Wifi, like the Raspberry Pi Model 3. To add WiFi to your Nano, here are a few options:

* M.2 Card. Similar to the WiFi/Bluetooth card found inside many laptop computers. Installing the card on the Nano is relatively simple. But adding antennas to the M.2 card caused me to question how/why M.2 devices are sold! Fortunately, there's an easier way to add WiFi to the Jetson Nano.

### Gotcha: Running the Demos

Running the Nano's demos from their original directory will require you to use `sudo` for compilation and execution. Not a good use of sudo, in my opinion. To avoid this extra step, copy the demos into your `$HOME` directory like so:


```


```

Next, you can compile and run the `smoke` demo as follows:

```


```

Note that compilation can take a few minutes (or even as long as 30 minutes) for some of the demos. Compilation for GPU-accelerated programs requires these major steps:

* Compliing executables for the host. In the case of the Nano, this step users `gcc`, the GNU C Compiler, to target the four ARM-based cores where the Linux4Tegra operating system runs.
* Using `nvcc`, the Nvidia C compiler, to compile those parts of the code that will run on the GPU.
* Linking the two machine-readable files with the appropriate libraries to form a single object file that can be executed.




### How to Instal the M.2 Card


### How to Install a USB WiFi Adapter

First, be sure to get the Edimax WiFi adapater, available from Amazon.  This is the model recommended by an Nvidia engineer that I met at GTC 2019. The Nano recognizes the Edimax almost immediately; looks like drivers for the device are  included with the Linux4Tegra distro.


### Gotcha: Power Requirements





* Large form factor. Not a complaint, but an observation. The Jetson Nano is about 60% larger than the Raspberry Pi Model 3, and the Nano requires a larger heatsink.

### Jetson Nano vs Raspberry Pi

<img src="/images/nvidia-jetson-nano-vs-raspberry-pi.jpg" width="600" align="center" alt="Nvidia Jetson Nano vs Raspberry Pi" title="Nvidia Jetson Nano vs Raspberry Pi" />

The Jetson Nano is a larger than a Raspberry Pi, but itâ€™s still small enough to fit in your hand. That makes it well suited for robotics projects, like the Pi. 

GPIO pin configuration is the same as Raspberry Pi?? Verify this!


### Jetson Nano vs Parallella

The Jetson Nano might be more readily compared against the [Parallella](/blog/2014/07/07/parallella-quick-start-guide-with-gotchas/) board.
