The Jetson Nano is a larger than a Raspberry Pi, but itâ€™s still small enough to fit in your hand. That makes it well suited for robotics projects, like the Pi. 

GPIO pin configuration is the same as Raspberry Pi?? Verify this!


### Jetson Nano vs Parallella

The Jetson Nano might be more readily compared against the [Parallella](/blog/2014/07/07/parallella-quick-start-guide-with-gotchas/) board.
