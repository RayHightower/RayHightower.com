The Nvidia Jetson Nano is a single board computer slightly larger than a Raspberry Pi. This Linux-powered device has 128 GPU cores that support CUDA, the Nvidia library that lets developers write GPU-accelerated code in high level languages. Further, the Nano's $99 price makes GPUs available for some cool hobbyist experiments. When powerful technology becomes available to hobbyists, exciting products (and even industries) can be born.

### Jetson Nano, Up & Running

This article will show the reader how to get started with the Jetson Nano as rapidly as possible. You will be able to:

* Burn an SD card with the appropriate Linux4Tegra image.
* Compile and run the GPU-accelerated demos that come with the image.
* Write, compile, and run a GPU-accelerated "Hello World" program using Nvidia's CUDA library.
* Measure the performance improvement that comes from GPU-accelerated code.
* Save time by avoiding some of the _gotchas_ that got me.

Let's get started!

### Additional Items Required

The Jetson Nano box includes the Nano and that's about it. Here are the
additional items you'll need to get up and running.

* One micro-SD card with at least least 64GB of storage capacity. SanDisk Class 10 cards work well for me.
* Power adapter. A micro-USB cable will provide sufficient power for less intensive tasks. But for intensive tasks, you'll need a ((barrel connetor adapater)). The "why" behind this choice is given in the next section.
* HDMI or DisplayPort cable. Or both, because the Nano is powerful enough to drive two monitors at once.
* HDMI or DisplayPort monitor.
* USB keyboard & mouse
* Ethernet cable (for wired connections)
* EDIMax WiFi dongle or M.2 card. Details discussed below.
* Case or other mounting device. I fastned my Nano to a block of wood with screws. That way, folks can handle the device without touching the circuit board. Friends at [BLUE](http://thebluelacuna.com) 3D-printed a case that I plan to use for my second Nano.

### Gotcha: Power Requirements

There are three ways to apply power to the Nano (voltage in both cases = 5V):

* Micro-USB. The _gotcha_: At most, this method will provide 2A of current to the Jetson Nano. GPU-intensive tasks will require more current. And if you exceed the current that can be provided by the power source, the Nano will either hang or shut down entirely.

* 3.5mm Barrel connector (verify size!!!!!!!). This source will supply up to 4A of current, more than enough for any task that can be run on the Nano.

* Power Over Ethernet (POE).

The micro-USB option is enabled by default. To switch to the higher-amperager barrel connector, apply a jumper to pins XX and YY as shown in the above photo.

Why choose one over the other? For micro-USB, convenience. Most people have micro-USB cables lying around because they were used to power Android phones, Amazon Kindles, and other devices over the past decade.

Of course, remember the gotcha. Some micro-USB cables are not equipped to carry 2A of current at 5V. Some of you may remember the formula for resistance in a material, given the resistivity of the material, the length of the cable, and the cross-sectional area. A short thick cable will perform better than a long thin cable in this instance.

In my experience, the barrel connector is best because it eliminates uncertainty. You can pick one up from Amazon for about twenty dollars. Well worth it.

### Jetson Nano Product Highlights

Here are some Jetson Nano specs at a glance:

* 4 ARM cores + 128 GPU cores. Linux4Tegra runs on the ARM cores, in the same way that Raspian runs on the ARM cores on the Raspberry Pi.
* Support for CUDA, the Nvidia library that lets you write GPU-accelerated code in high level languages like C, C++, Python, Java, Ruby.
* An array of general purpose input/output (GPIO) pins compatible with the pin configuration of the Raspberry Pi. Theoretically, if you have a robot powered by a Raspberry PI, you can add GPU acceleration by replacing the Pi with a Jetson Nano.
* A camera connector that's compatible with the standard Raspberry Pi camera.
* Operating system: Linux4Tegra, an Ubuntu-based distro customized by Nvidia.
* Price: $99.

You might think of the 128-core GPU as specialist that performs a certain task extremely fast and extremely well. Most of the code runs on the ARM cores. But when the time comes for rapid floating point mathematics, we call in the GPU.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

`Ctrl + Alt + T` Open a terminal window. 



### Downoad and Burn the SD Card Image

As of this writing, the SD card image is roughly 5GB in size, and it expands larger than 12GB. You might want to begin the download & burn process now and let that run in the background while you review the rest of this article.

* Download the [Jetson Nano SD Card image]().
* Decompress the image.
* Use [balenaEtcher]() to burn the image on to an SD Card. Note: In past articles about single board computers, I listed all of the detailed steps for burning an image from the command line because I had not found a GUI utility that worked reliably. But I was recently introduced balenaEtcher, and it works well.
* Insert the new SD card into the Jetson Nano and apply the power. Watch it boot!


### What are GPUs?

A recent post on the [Nvidia GPU Technology Conference](/blog/2019/03/28/nvidia-gpu-technology-conference-2019/) gives a quick overview of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and some examples of how GPUs are used.

### What is CUDA?

CUDA stands for Compute Unified Device Architecture. In the early days of GPU-accelerated computing, deveopers would need to study _how_ graphics acceleration works in order to adapt non-graphics problems to GPUs. CUDA adds a layer of abstraction so that you can write software for GPUs without studying the principles of computer graphics.

Nvidia created CUDA, so CUDA only runs on GPU products from Nvidia.

### Sound Thru HDMI

The Nano's HDMI port carries both sound and video. To enable sound, navigate to ` Settings  | Sound ` and choose `HDMI/DisplayPort` in the `Play sound through` section of the dialog box.



### Gotcha: WiFi Not Included

It was surprising to learn that the Jetson Nano did not come with built-in Wifi, like the Raspberry Pi Model 3. Fortunately, the device comes with gigabit Ethernet, so you can plug it directly into your router while you're waiting for a WiFi device to arrive.

To add WiFi to your Nano, here are a few options:

<img src="/images/intel-m2-for-jetson_nano.jpg" width="200" align="righht" alt="Intel M.2 card adds WiFi and Bluetooth to Jetson Nano" title="Intel M.2 card adds WiFi and Bluetooth to Jetson Nano" />

* M.2 Card. Similar to the WiFi/Bluetooth card found inside many laptop computers. Installing the card on the Nano is relatively simple. But adding antennas to the M.2 card caused me to question how/why M.2 devices are sold! Fortunately, there's an easier way to add WiFi to the Jetson Nano.

* EDIMax USB WiFi Dongle. This device is truly much smaller than a dongle.


### Gotcha: Running the Demos

Running the Nano's demos from their original directory will require you to use `sudo` for compilation and execution. Not a good use of sudo, in my opinion. To avoid this extra step, copy the demos into your `$HOME` directory like so:


```


```

Next, you can compile and run the `smoke` demo as follows:

```


```

Note that compilation can take a few minutes (or even as long as 30 minutes) for some of the demos. Compilation for GPU-accelerated programs requires these major steps:

* Compliing executables for the host. In the case of the Nano, this step users `gcc`, the GNU C Compiler, to target the four ARM-based cores where the Linux4Tegra operating system runs.
* Using `nvcc`, the Nvidia C compiler, to compile those parts of the code that will run on the GPU.
* Linking the two machine-readable files with the appropriate libraries to form a single object file that can be executed.


### Installing VNC (w/a Few Gotchas)

For VNC, you need...

### How to Install a USB WiFi Adapter

First, be sure to get the Edimax WiFi adapater, available from Amazon.  This is the model recommended by an Nvidia engineer that I met at GTC 2019. The Nano recognizes the Edimax almost immediately; looks like drivers for the device are  included with the Linux4Tegra distro.


### Gotcha: Power Requirements





* Large form factor. Not a complaint, but an observation. The Jetson Nano is about 60% larger than the Raspberry Pi Model 3, and the Nano requires a larger heatsink.

### Jetson Nano vs Raspberry Pi

<img src="/images/nvidia-jetson-nano-vs-raspberry-pi.jpg" width="600" align="center" alt="Nvidia Jetson Nano vs Raspberry Pi" title="Nvidia Jetson Nano vs Raspberry Pi" />

The Jetson Nano is a larger than a Raspberry Pi, but itâ€™s still small enough to fit in your hand. That makes it well suited for robotics projects, like the Pi. 

GPIO pin configuration is the same as Raspberry Pi?? Verify this!


### Jetson Nano vs Parallella

The Jetson Nano might be more readily compared against the [Parallella](/blog/2014/07/07/parallella-quick-start-guide-with-gotchas/) board.

### Shut Up and Take My Money

The price/performance ratio of this device was so compelling that I tried to buy one while the product was still being announced on the [GTC stage](/blog/2019/03/28/nvidia-gpu-technology-conference-2019/). A true "shut up and take my money" moment.


roughly the size of features four ARM cores and 128 GPU cores. Makers of the board are on a mission to bring AI to everyone.
