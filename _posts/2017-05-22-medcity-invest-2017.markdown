>We don't have years, anymore, to make a decision. We have months. Or in some cases, weeks.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>~ Bruce Brandes, CEO of <a href="http://lucro.com/">Lucro</a>

Every profession faces the pressure of accelerating change, especially healthecare. Decisions that once took years must now be made in weeks, days, or sooner. Fortunately, improvements in technology are helping physicians and other pros to match today's pace.

The [MedCity INVEST](http://events.medcitynews.com/invest/) conference gathers physicians, investors, engineers, and entrepreneurs with a shared interest: Everyone is striving to improve healthcare for patients. The event is produced by [MedCity News](http://medcitynews.com). Collaboration produces awesome results.

And this is only the beginning.

### Barbarians at the Gate

[Arundhati Parmar](http://twitter.com/aparmarbb), VP and Editorial Director of MedCity News, opened the conference with an observation about "barbarians at the gate": People from _outside_ the medical profession with ideas for improvement. 

Fortunately, medical pros are clever. They've leveraged the barbarians into allies. Some physicians partner with electrical and mechanical engineers to create devices. Others join forces with software developers to build apps. Thinking further outside the box, financial experts have been invited to the table to come up with creative ways to pay for the new ideas. Yes, collaboration produces awesome results.

For example...

### Using Virtual Reality to Reduce Pain

Drugs make the pain go away. But drugs can also have nasty side-effects like nausea and addiction.

What if there was a way to treat pain without drugs? Enter virtual reality (VR).

[David Rhew](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-rhew-m-d-1832764/) is a physician and the Chief Medical Officer at Samsung. During his keynote at MedCity INVEST, he shared the following MRI image to show how patients using VR have less pain than patients who are not using VR. In the scans, the yellow areas indicate pain; more yellow means more pain.

Here's why VR works. Pain requires conscious attention. Conscious attention focuses on pain like a spotlight. But VR immerses patients into a separate world that stimulates the senses, drawing attention away from the pain. Patients feel better without (or with reduced) medication, and without the unpleasant side-effects that drugs produce.









### Conclusion

MedCity INVEST was powerful gathering of motivated minds united in a common quest: To make healthcare better.

For thousands of years, physicians have created new ways to prevent and cure illness. All of us live better lives because of their work. 

The tradition of improved healthcare continues, even in the face of rapid change. To stay ahead, medical professionals are leveraging ideas from other fields. Some physicians collaborate with engineers to design diagnostic devices. Others partner with software developers build apps. Multi-disciplinary teams join forces to improve workflow in hospitals. The outlook is promising.
