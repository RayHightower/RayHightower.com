### About the Presenter

At age 26, [Catherine Bell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherinebell-tig/) arrived in the United States with nothing but grit and a dream. By age 30, she and her late husband had built and sold a multi-million- dollar company, achieving what many call the American Dream.

But Catherine didn’t stop there. She realized true financial freedom comes from passive income and building wealth that creates a ripple effect of impact.

Today, Catherine Bell uses AI to grow multiple businesses. Join us for lunch and learn how.

### Your Hosts

This AI gathering is brought to you by [AZMM.org](https://https://azmm.org), the Arizona Multifamily MasterMind Group. We meet every Friday at 6:55am (yes, AM) like clockwork. And sometimes we gather for lunch.
