One reason to attend conferences: To discover trends while we still have time to be on the cutting edge.

The Information Management Network (IMN) runs events for investment and finacial professionals across the planet. (across the USA???)

### Tech

My background includes four decades of technology, including two decades running the company that I launched from scratch. 

Tech can't cover up for poor business practices.

### Conclusion

I reduced my conference calendar this year in order to spend more time traveling to properties.

My conference calendar consists mainly of tech-focused events where I’ve built a solid network over the years. IIREC was interesting because I didn’t know any of the other attendees prior to the conference. Launching Bridgetown Partners has given me an opportunity to expand my service to others through my professional network. Let the connecting begin.

To the IMN Phoenix organizers: Thank you for creating a powerful event!
