[CohesiveFT](http://cohesiveft.com) hosted a CloudCamp Developer Night this week. Speakers were Philip Szalwinski of 8th Light, John Downey of Braintree, Marcy Capron of Polymathic, and me. My presentation, [Citizen Science With OpenROV](/blog/2014/06/16/citizen-science-with-openrov/), was based on the blog post of the same name.

Thank you [Margaret Walker](https://twitter.com/MargieWalker) for running a great event. Slides appear below.
