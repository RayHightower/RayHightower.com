The best companies serve customers in new, non-trivial ways. A few examples: Google and Tesla. 

Google was not the first search engine; over ten search engines had a healthy head-start. But Google was the first to serve two key sets of customers simultaneously:
* Web users, who want quick search results with minimal clutter. Google's search page is sparse!

1. The <b>Engineering</b> Question<br/>
Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements? 
2. The <b>Timing</b> Question 
Is now the right time to start your particular business? 
3. The <b>Monopoly</b> Question<br/>
Are you starting with a big share of a small market? 
4. The <b>People</b> Question<br/>

5. The <b>Distribution</b> Question<br/>
Do you have a way to not just create but deliver your product? 
6. The <b>Durability</b> Question<br/>
Will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future? 
7. The <b>Secret</b> Question<br/>
Have you identified a unique opportunity that others donâ€™t see?
