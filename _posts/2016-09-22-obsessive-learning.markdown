>I do the learning thing pretty obsessively.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>~Mandla Magagula’s Twitter profile

Yesterday morning, I had a Skype call with [Mandla Magagula](https://twitter.com/mandlamag), a software developer based in Johannesburg, South Africa. By day he builds software. And when he’s not at work, Mandla and his team teach software craftsmanship to youth in Johannesburg. Mandla and I met at Ruby Fuza 2015 in Cape Town. His passion for teaching and learning is self-evident to anyone he meets. Check out his presentation video:

## Software Craftsmanship is Global

During our Skype call, we talked about [8th Light’s acquisition of WisdomGroup](https://8thlight.com/blog/paul-pagel/2016/09/12/8th-light-acquisition-wisdomgroup.html), and within a few minutes our conversation turned to Mandla's thoughts about training the next generation of developers. Conversations like this are powerful, especially when the talking ends and the action begins. In Mandla's case, action takes form in [Uzuko Hill](http://www.uzukohill.org/), the training organization that he formed with a colleague, Theo Bohnen. Uzuko Hill launched with a handful of students, and they grow every year.


I’ve had similar craftsmanship conversations with developers from other regions of Planet Earth.

Every time I have this conversation with someone from another country, I'm struck by the global nature of software craftsmanship.

When

What struck me about the conversation:

Craftsmanship is global.
The desire to improve, the desire to get better at one’s profession, that’s global.

[SCNA](http://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.com/) and

Some people within a profession just want to go to work, do the bare minimum, and then go home. That’s okay... for them.
But some people want to continuously hone their skills, to strive towards mastery.
It’s possible to achieve mastery at a sustainable pace, without burning yourself out. The way to do that is by working with others who are on the path to mastery. We talk to each other, we listen to each other, and together we grow. Together we get better along the path to mastery.

That’s what SCNA is all about. In face, you could argue that the “NA” part of SCNA is a misnomer. SCNA is held in North America, but craftsmanship is a passion that goes far beyond the boundaries of one continent. The desire for craftsmanship is global.

If you feel this way, if you have a passion for excellence, come join us at SCNA. Let’s work towards mastery together.

SCNA has built a global reputation for excellence in education and networking.
