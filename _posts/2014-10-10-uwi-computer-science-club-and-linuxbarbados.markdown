Members of the [University of the West Indies (UWI)](http://cavehill.uwi.edu/) Computer Science Club and [LinuxBarbados](http://linuxbarbados.org) just finished a joint session this afternoon. I am grateful that the group invited me to present. Outline (prepared in advance):

* 30 minutes: Overview of Ruby, Rails, and some alternatives to both. What are the advantages and disadvantages of building web apps with Ruby? Can you build a business with this stuff?

* 30 minutes: Questions and Answers. This will be a highly interactive time. Anything discussed earlier is fair game. We can explore technical specifics if you like.

* 60 minutes: Deep dive into anything the group wants to explore related to technology, business, or the combination of the two. If the group doesn't choose a topic, we will end early. But if the group is interested and engaged, we will continue.
