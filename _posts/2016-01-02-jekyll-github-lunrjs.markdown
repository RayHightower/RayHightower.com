This blog is built on three powerful tools, commonly used in the open source community:

* [Jekyll](/blog/2016/01/04/how-to-make-lunrjs-jekyll-work-together/), the Ruby-based static page generator. Static pages are fast because there's no database to hit.

* [GitHub](/blog/2015/07/22/github-pages-quick-start-guide/), the collaboration tool for developers. Also useful for hosting and its content delivery network. 

* [lunr.js](http://lunrjs.com), which gives visitors fast search capabilities. lunr.js is fast because search requests never hit the network. The entire search workflow happens in the browser.
