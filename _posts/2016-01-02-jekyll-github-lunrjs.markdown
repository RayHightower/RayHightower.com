This blog is built on three powerful tools, commonly used in the open source community:

* [Jekyll](/blog/2015/06/24/getting-started-with-jekyll/), the Ruby-based static page generator. 

* [GitHub](/blog/2015/07/22/github-pages-quick-start-guide/), the collaboration tool, used for hosting and its content delivery network. 

* [lunr.js](http://lunrjs.com) to give visitors fast search capabilities.

Members of [ChicagoRuby: North Shore](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRuby/events/225788039/) gathered on Saturday, January 2, 2016 to share ideas on effective ways to use the tools. Slides appear below.
