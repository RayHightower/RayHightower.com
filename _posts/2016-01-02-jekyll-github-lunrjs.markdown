This post tells how to combine three open source tools into a powerful blog or web site.

* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the Ruby-based static page generator. 

* [GitHub](http://github.com), the collaboration tool, used for hosting and its content delivery network. 

* [LunrJS](http://lunrjs.com) to give your visitors fast search capabilities.
