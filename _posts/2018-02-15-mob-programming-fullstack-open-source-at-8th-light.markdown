Developers who are hungry for knowledge will enjoy these two upcoming events:

* Tue, 2/20/2018: Mob Programming, with Woody Zuill
* Wed, 2/21/2018: Fullstack Open Source

Both events will be held at the [8th Light](http://8thlight.com) office in downtown Los Angeles. The Mob Programming event will be filmed and refreshments will be served. Video footage may be used on [cleancoders.com](http://cleancoders.com) or in any of Woody Zull's training material. By participating, you are consenting to the use of the footage in that context.

### About Mob Programming
Perhaps you're familiar with pair programming: Two developers working together to solve a single problem. Mob programming takes pairing to another level. At Tuesday's even, Woody Zuill will demonstrate how mob programming can increase the quality of code while reducing bugs.

[Be sure to RSVP here](https://www.meetup.com/LA-Software-Craftsmanship/events/247787129/) to get the exact address and so that we can have refreshments waiting for you. See you then!

### About Fullstack Open Source

One of the best ways to ramp up in skill: Work with others who have the same goal. All developers are welcome to participate regardless of skill level.

As always, you can [RSVP for Fullstack Open Source here](https://www.meetup.com/la-fullstack/events/xnkccpyxdbcc/) so we can order refreshments for you.

See you soon!
