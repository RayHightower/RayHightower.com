I don't know [Kris Bickerstaff](https://www.instagram.com/krisbickerstaff), personally. But his words about capitalism vs socialism are compelling enough to deserve publication here at RayHightower.com. 

Perhaps these words give you the same positive lift that they give me.

>A guy looked at my airplane the other day and said I wonder how many people I could have fed for the price of that airplane...<br/>&nbsp;<br/>I replied I am not sure, it fed a lot of families at the Dassault factory where it was built. I’m sure it fed a bunch of families that rolled the aluminum at the Alcoa factory. It surely fed a lot of people at the Honeywell factory where the experts built the turbines. It fed a whole company for a few weeks when I had them build me a new interior. It feeds the families of the linemen that fuel it.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>That’s the difference between capitalism and a welfare mentality. When you buy something, you put money in people's pockets, and give them dignity for their skills.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>When you give someone something for nothing, you rob them of their dignity and self worth.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Capitalism is freely giving your money in exchange for something of value.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Socialism is taking your money against your will and shoving something down your throat that you never asked for.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>

Well said, Kris Bickerstaff.
