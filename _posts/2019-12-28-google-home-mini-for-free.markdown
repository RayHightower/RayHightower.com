Interesting offer, received via email today. Google is offering a “free” Google Home Mini to users of the Spotify music service. All you have to do is connect your Spotify account to your Google account. And then Google will send you a free listening device equipped with voice recognition and artificial intelligence. 

A free listening device for the home.

### What Does This Mean?

What does it mean when companies give away the hardware for free? 

A wise person once said "if you’re not paying for the product, then you _are_ the product."

### Trade Offs

Humans have made this trade-off before. For example, television survived and grew through commercials. The offer from the TV networks: Sit through these advertising jingles promoting soap, the latest car, or pharmaceuticals and we’ll give you an hour of entertainment. We’ve all traded our time and attention in exchange for entertainment before. 

Why is the Google offer different?
