Appleâ€™s latest laptop operating system, macOS Catalina, includes a feature that took me by surprise: Sidecar. Let's say that you're working in a coffee shop and you need additional screen real estate. Sidecar will let your iPad function as a second display.

### Pleasant Discovery

I stumbled across Sidecar right after upgrading to Catalina. Looking through System Preferences, I saw an unfamiliar icon next to `Displays`. Clicking on the new icon revealed Sidecar. The name and the logo are perfect; Mac users will immediately know what to do.

### What About Duet?

Like many readers of this blog, I was a [Duet](https://www.duetdisplay.com) user. Duet is still useful for users who need MS Windows or Android support. Plus, competition between Duet and Apple will encourage both teams to keep innovating.

### Real World Experience

Sidecar crashed during my first few experiences with the feature. Fortunately, the latest macOS updates seem to be stable.

Try it out!
