Apple’s latest laptop operating system, macOS Catalina, includes a feature that took me completely by surprise: Sidecar.

I stumbled across Sidecar right after upgrading to Catalina. Looking through System Preferences, I saw an unfamiliar icon next to `Displays`. Clicking on the new icon revealed Sidecar. The name and the logo are perfect; Mac users will immediately know what to do.

### Real World Experience

Sidecar crashed during my first few experiences with the feature. Fortunately, Apple’s latest macOS update seems to offer a stable Sidecar.

Try it out!
