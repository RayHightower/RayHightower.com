This afternoon I was invited to speak at the June [Table Talks](http://www.tablexi.com/blog/2013/06/developer-education-june-table-talks/developers/) hosted by Table XI. Today's theme was developer education. My topic: _Practice Begins With Play_. Developers who want to achieve mastery have many practice resources to choose from, including open source hardware like [Raspbery Pi](/blog/2012/12/03/ruby-on-raspberry-pi/), [BeagleBone Black](/blog/2013/05/22/beaglebone-black-up-and-running/), and [Parallella](http://parallella.org).

####PechaKucha
Presentations were given in the [PechaKucha](http://www.pechakucha.org/faq) format, which encourages presenters to deliver the maximimum amount of useful information in a relatively short time. Each presenter is only allowed twenty slides, with twenty seconds per slide. Truly high impact!

####Slides and Video
Slides from the talk appear below. Video will be posted here as soon as it becomes available. _Update: Video has been [posted](/blog/2013/06/27/pechakucha-developer-education-at-tablexi/)._

Thank you Table XI for the invitation!
