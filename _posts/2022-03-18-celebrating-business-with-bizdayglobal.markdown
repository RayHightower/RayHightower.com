### What is Business?

From the [BizDayGlobal](https://bizdayglobal.com) 44-second intro:

* Business is cooperation.
* Business inspires all of us to work together, and to win together.
* Business lets us manufacture in Singapore and ship to Barbados through locks engineered in Panama, financed in Switzerland.
* Business enables each of us to specialize in a skill, and to convert our valuable output into currency. Through business, we can trade our currency with other specialists to get the things we need.
* Business enables a physician in Nairobi to use a computer designed in Cupertino to order medical supplies conceived in Berlin from a factory operating in Shenzhen.
* Business is Ubuntu, the Zulu word meaning "I am because we are."
* Business links all of us together.
