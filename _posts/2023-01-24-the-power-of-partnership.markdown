[Bridgetown Partners](https://BridgetownPartners.com) moved to the State of Arizona in October of 2020. Four months later, we closed our first investment in the State: 93 units in Tucson. 

We did this with partners. We've formed wonderful relationships with mentors and partners in the states where we operate. Collaborating with partners is a powerful way to achieve any goal.
