I moved [Bridgetown Partners](https://BridgetownPartners.com) to the State of Arizona in October of 2020. During the pandemic, before the vaccines. Four months later, we closed our first investment in the State: 93 units in Tucson. 

We did this with partners. We've formed wonderful relationships with mentors and partners in the states where we operate. Collaborating with partners is a powerful way to achieve any goal.

### Deal History

As of this writing, we've closed the following deals:

* 93 units in Tucson, AZ
* 302 units in Phoenix, AZ
* 28 units in Phoenix, AZ
* 146 units in Sierra Vista, AZ

Partnerships enable each member of the team to focus on our respective strengths. Two companies coming together, with complementary strengths, can achieve exponentially more than either of them should accomplish alone.

### Partnerships and You
