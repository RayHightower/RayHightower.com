High-achieving humans are consistently striving for the next goal. And we tend to beat ourselves up over goals we've missed instead of celebrating the goals we've accomplished.

If you're reading this post, you're probably a high-achieving human. And you may have some experience with self-flagellation. Question for you: If beating yourself up was the path to success, wouldn't you be perfect by now?

### The Gap and the Gain

Dan Sullivan and Dr. Benjamin Hardy offer powerful arguments for for focusing on our gains instead of our gaps. They have packaged their findings in _The Gap and the Gain_. The book contains powerful ideas for recovering from gap-focus.

Note: Gap vs Gain is an ongoing battle for me. I will not pretend to be an expert on the subject. Rather, this post will summarize a few Gap vs Gain concepts:

* Making the boat go faster.
* Mental subtraction. 
* The 5-minute rule. 

These three points are just a small sample of the content. I encourage you to read the entire book.


### Definitions

As you can see from the graphic at the top of this article, the Gap is that space between our current state and the _ideal state_ we're striving to achieve. Of course, the ideal state is a moving target because we always want to strive for more. Therefore the Gap grows every larger, a source of ever-increasing frustration for high achievers.

The Gain is what we've achieved so far. The Gain is concrete and measurable because we've already achieved it. The Gain is an every growing list of achievements that we can be proud if.

When I first read _The Gap and the Gain_, and when I understood the concept of focusing on the Gain, I was concerned about something my father warned me about decades ago: Resting on my laurels. But focusing on the Gain is not about resting on laurels. Measuring and focusing on the Gain is a way to give ourselves encouragement so that we have the courage and energy to keep achieving more.

### Results Achieved

The core concept of focusing on the _GAIN_ was discovered through real-world experience with over 20,000 entrepreneurs.

### A Few Key Concepts

Key idea from the book: If we're not regularly reminded of our GAINS, itâ€™s easy to go into the GAP and lose hope. This post will discuss three concepts from the book:
