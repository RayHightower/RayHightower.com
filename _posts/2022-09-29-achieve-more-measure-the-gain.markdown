High-achieving humans are always striving for the next goal. And we tend to beat ourselves up over goals we've missed instead of celebrating the goals we've accomplished.

If you're reading this post, you're probably a high-achieving human. And you may have some experience with self-flagellation. Question for you: If beating yourself up was the path to success, wouldn't you be perfect by now?

### Full Disclosure

I am guilty of this behavior too. A friend's recommendation led me to _The Gap and the Gain_  by Dan Sullivan and Benjamin Hardy. The book contains powerful ideas for recovering from gap-focus. 


### A Few Key Concepts

Key idea from the book: If we're not regularly reminded of our GAINS, itâ€™s easy to go into the GAP and lose hope. This post will discuss three concepts from the book:

* Making the boat go faster.
* Mental subtraction. 
* The 5-minute rule.
