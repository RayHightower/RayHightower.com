Take a look at the northern Phoenix sky on an early morning. You might see hot air balloons taking off. Clusters of balloons with baskets suspended underneath. Baskets full of smiling people.

I recently took a ride in one of those balloons. Kudos to [Hot Air Expeditions](https://hotairexpeditions.com) for offering an exciting early-morning experience.

The balloon ride was a fun experience with plenty of business lessons, too.

### The Weather Will Influence Your Progress


### Some Stuff You Control, Some Stuff You Don't

Our balloon pilot was a veteran of the industry with decades of experience.



### Celebrate Success

Hot Air Expeditions fed us a champaign breakfast after our ride. Our group celebrated and laughed together. Our pilot told balloon jokes. What a morning!
