>When people are looking down the barrel of failure in their lives, they will do whatever it takes to get themselves moving...<br/>&nbsp;<br/>-Jeff Olson, Author of _The Slight Edge_

Jeff Olson is a performance coach who has spent years observing business professionals. Especially himself. After watching people make and lose fortunes in business, athletics, and other worthy endeavors, Olson documented the patterns of survival, failure, success, and self-sabotage that all of us fall into from time to time. 

Humans are pattern-recognition engines. When we see a pattern and when we know what to do about it, we can improve our results. That's the key message of _The Slight Edge_.

### Failure, Survival, & Success

Ever noticed how focused you become when faced with a deadline? Yeah, me too. Within each of us, there's a potential failure and a potential success. When we're facing down the gun-barrel of a deadline, we focus our minds, we execute, and we get the mission done. If you're like me, you might think: "How can I make myself focus like that all the time?"

We already know what tasks to perform to take ourselves from comfort to massive success. We just need to perform the tasks consistently over time. And then the results will grow over time like compound interest in an investment account. If it's really that easy, why don't we do it?

### Patience

According to Olson, we know what to do and we're capable of doing it for a time. But when our expectations of massive results are not met _immediately_, say within the first thirey days, we give up. Is there a secret we can leverage to push ourselves beyond that period of initial enthusiasm? Yes. We need to change the way we think about everyday things.
