[BLUE1647](http://blue1647.com) is an amazing maker space on the South Side of Chicago. Each month [ChicagoRuby](http://chicagoruby.org) hosts an event at the space.

This month featured the Internet of Things (IoT).

What does IoT mean for Ruby developers? How can someone with a web development background begin exploring IoT? And why would a web developer care? This is an updated version of the presentation delivered at ChicagoRuby on 12/1/2015.
