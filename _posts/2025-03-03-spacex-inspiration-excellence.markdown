SpaceX is building and launching rockets in Starbase, TX (formerly known as Boca Chica). 

I have visited Starbase every year since 2021. The above video is from my trip in July 2024.

Why visit Starbase? Because the experience is absolutely inspiring!

SpaceX is on a mission to make humans multi-planetary. 

To accomplish this goal, SpaceX is:
* Building the largest rockets ever created.

* Fueling the rockets with methane (instead of regular kerosene-type rocket fuel) because methane is easier to synthesize on any planet with water + carbon dioxide, like Mars.

* Making the rockets reusable, to keep costs down and make space reachable. 

SpaceX is the first company to create reusable rockets. This is a big deal, a major feat of business acumen and engineering skill!

At [ROIClear](https://ROIClear.com), we admire people and teams who do things well. And we learn from them. We look forward to learning more from SpaceX in coming years!
