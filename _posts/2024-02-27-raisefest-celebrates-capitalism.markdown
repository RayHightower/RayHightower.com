Over 1,000 capital raisers attended [RaiseFest](https://raisefest.com) in Phoenix last week. The event attracts fund managers, investors, and related professionals. We gathered for quality presentations, networking, and fun. 

RaiseFest is a celebration of capitalism. When good people conduct business, everybody wins.

### Panel: The Entrepreneurial Path Less Taken

I was grateful to serve on a panel at this year's RaiseFest. Our moderator, Carlos Salguero, posed excellent questions and kept the discussion moving. To my fellow panelists, Bryan Escudero, Madhavi Nade Jain, and Vasu Kakarlapudi: It was great serving with you, and I look forward to working with you again!

### Gratitude

So many people came together to make the event a success. Special thanks to the following:

* Dr. Jennifer Harris and Jose Miller: Thanks for the photos!
* Hunter Thompson: Thanks again for RaiseFest. Looking forward to next year!
