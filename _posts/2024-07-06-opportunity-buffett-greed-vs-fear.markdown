>Be greedy when others are fearful. Be fearful when others are greedy.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>-Warren Buffett

That's not a quote about greed. It's a quote about opportunity. In other words, jump on opportunities when they present themselves, even if other people don't recognize them as such. As long as you've done your homework, as long as you're making a rational decision based on sound business principles, jump!
