While reading Del Denney's [High Performance Playbook](/blog/2022/06/30/high-performance-playbook/), I came to the section about his skydiving experience.

"I always wanted to skydive", I thought to myself.

So I dropped the book, found a skydiving company, and made a reservation.

### Taking Action

One week later, I jumped out of a perfectly good airplane (with a parachute and a guide).

When my family saw the video, they thought I was nuts. All except for one cousin. She had jumped out of a plane a few years earlier. Maybe both of us are nuts!

### Do It Now

What is something you've always wanted to do? Why not do it now! Examples:
* I always wanted to start a company.
* I always wanted to invest in real estate.
* I always wanted to ask that girl (or guy) out on a date.
* I always wanted to travel to Antarctica.

You get the idea.

### Sense of Urgency

Now that you know what you want to do, take action. Put down your phone, close your laptop, and take the first step.

For example: If you're starting a company, call your first potential customer. Taking that first step will give you the momentum you need to take another.

### Take Action. Gain Momentum.

Take action now and gain momentum. With momentum, we can move mountains.

DO IT NOW!
