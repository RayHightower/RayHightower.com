Consistency is one of the most effective tools we can use to keep customers coming back for more. When first-time customers become repeat customers, revenue explodes (in a positive way). Customers trust brands like Starbucks, Apple, and Google because expectations and delivery are consistently in alignment.

How does a company achieve consistency? Through processes.

### The Process Component

This article is part of a series on [Traction and the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS)](/blog/2021/02/15/traction-entrepreneurial-operating-system-eos/). EOS is a set of tools that enables a business leader to grow a company while maintaining sanity. Today's EOS component: Process.

### Shout Out to E-Myth by Michael Gerber

The author of _Traction_ offers tribute to Michael Gerber, author of business classics _The E-Myth_ and _The E-Myth Revisited_. Gerber's point in his books (and speaches and interviews) is that the entrepreneur must create systems if they ever want to have a life outside of their business. We must view the business as a "pre-production prototype of a mass-producable product." When we systemize the business, we can step outside of it, fine-tune it, and scale it.

Business owners who complain about lack of control and lack of freedom need to work on systemizing their businesses.


### Core Processes at Bridgetown Partners

The following example is a little bit closer to home: [Bridgetown Partners](https://bridgetownpartners.com). Bridgetown manifests my vision for serving clients and customers by leveraging my history in commercial real estate, software development, and community service. The three layers support each other as shown in the diagram below.

This is how we define the layers at Bridgetown:

* **Commercial Real Estate**. At our foundation, we're a commercial real estate firm. We buy multifamily apartment properties and we improve them so people can have a great place to live. We also serve outside investors by giving their capital a place to grow at minimal risk.
* **Software Development**. The best software companies have a deep understanding of user needs. When the development company is also a user, understanding is amplified. As a commercial real estate firm, we are in a great position to observe the parts of our industry that need a boost from great software. Even better, the CRE foundation gives us time to fine-tune our finished software products (see _Runway_, below).
* **Community Service**. Money for the sake of money is meaningless. For decades, our leadership team has served the tech and business communities by leading groups and conferences. Currently, [BizDayGlobal](https://BizDayGlobal.com) and the [Arizona Multifamily Mastermind Group (AZMM.org)](https://AZMM.org) are our main community service vehicles.

We've structured Bridgetown so to produce a long _Runway_ for all of our ventures. With a longer runway, a product team has time to learn the market, experiment with products, learn from mistakes, and ultimately approach customers with products that they want to purchase with enthusiasm.
