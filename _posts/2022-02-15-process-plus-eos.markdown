### Process at Bridgetown Partners

The above diagram shows the core, big-picture process that drives Bridgetown Partners. There are three layers:
* **Commercial Real Estate**. At our foundation, we're a commercial real estate firm that buys multifamily apartment properties, fixes them up, and gives people a great place to live. We also serve outside investors by giving their capital a place to grow at minimal risk.
* **Software Development**. A major challenge with any business: Creating a product that customers will buy enthusiastically. As a commercial real estate firm, we are in a great position to observe the parts of the industry that can best be helped via software.
* **Community Service**. Money for the sake of money is meaningless. For decades, our leadership team has served the tech and business communities by leading groups and conferences. [BizDayGlobal](https://BizDayGlobal.com) is our current community service vehicle.

Runway = critical. The runway gives us time to learn the market, experiment with products, learn from our mistakes, and ultimately approach customers with a product that they want to purchase with enthusiasm.
