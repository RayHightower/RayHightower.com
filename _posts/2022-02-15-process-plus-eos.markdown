By way of example, we will share some of the processes we use within Bridgetown Partners. The Bridgetown Way.


### The Process Component

### Process at Bridgetown Partners

The above diagram shows the core, big-picture process that drives Bridgetown Partners. There are three layers:
* **Commercial Real Estate**. At our foundation, we're a commercial real estate firm. We buy multifamily apartment properties and we improve them so people can have a great place to live. We also serve outside investors by giving their capital a place to grow at minimal risk.
* **Software Development**. A major challenge with any business: Creating a product that customers will buy enthusiastically. As a commercial real estate firm, we are in a great position to observe the parts of the industry that can best be helped via software.
* **Community Service**. Money for the sake of money is meaningless. For decades, our leadership team has served the tech and business communities by leading groups and conferences. [BizDayGlobal](https://BizDayGlobal.com) is our main community service vehicle.

We've structured Bridgetown so to produce a long _Runway_ for all of our ventures. With a longer runway, a product team has time to learn the market, experiment with products, learn from mistakes, and ultimately approach customers with products that they want to purchase with enthusiasm.
