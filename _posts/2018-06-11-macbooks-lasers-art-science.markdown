A few people have asked about the laser-engraved symbols on my MacBook. One person described the etchings as nerdy tattoos. Whatever you want to call them, if you would like to do something similar, here's the procedure that worked for me.

And there's a brief description for each engraved symbol at the end of this post.

### Warranty

Does engraving void Apple’s warranty? I have no idea. The laser doesn't cut very deep. But if you're really concerned about the warranty, you might want to speak with Apple.

### Planning

I spent two months choosing and positioning the symbols. Laser engraving is expensive and permanent, so I wanted to get it right. Here's the chronolgy:

* Listing the symbols. I started by making a list of the symbols to be considered for inclusion. Evernote was great for keeping track of everything, because you can make notes anywhere and sync the info to all devices.
* Layout, first draft: Paper and pencil. Just to get a feel for the layout.
* Layout, intermediate drafts: Back to Evernote. I divided the surface of the MacBook into four quadrants, and I gathered the symbols into groups that seemed to work together. I kept the rules fluid, because this is art, not science.
* Layout, laser-ready. I chose [Affinity Designer]() because it can generate files in a variety of vector formats (.ai, .eps, .tiff) and  an ultra-smooth vector file would ensure a high-quality finished product. Unless you already own Adobe Illustrator, Affinity Designer is an inexpensive and effective way to go.

### Laser-Ready Layout

To align everything perfectly, I bought a template from [x on Etsy](). Some of the packages include templates for multiple devices, just in case you get the engraving bug and you can't stop with one laptop.

And even after everything was positioned and templated, I let the design rest for a week before taking it to the engraver. Because engraving is permanent!

### Choosing an Engraver

How does one choose an engraver for an expensive piece of electronic equipment? I found several engravers on the web, and visited a few in person. In the end, I chose [Chicago Award Source](). 

CAS uses an [Epilog Laser machine](https://www.epiloglaser.com/). But it goes beyond equipment. The engraving team needs to care deeply about alignment and attention to detail. The CAS team (Firoz, Christan, and Jenna) did an outstanding job with my engraving. Christan and Jenna were meticulous with the laser machine, double- and triple-checking the alignment. I emailed them a PDF before my visit, and they did a practice run on scrap acrylic. The acrylic aligned perfectly with the MacBook. It was clear that I had placed my trust in the right engraver.

That's CAS's equipment in action at the head of this blog post.

### Symbol Descriptions

Here's a description for each of the symbols, starting the the top-left corner and moving down, and then left to right.

* **Bloch Sphere**. Graphical representation of a quibit, the quantum computing equivalent of a digital computer's bit. Quantum computing is fascinating largely because we know so little about quantum mechanics.
* **Full-wave rectifier**. The fundamental circuit of every computer power supply because it's the first step in turning alternating current (from the electrical outlet) into direct current that our computers can use.
* **Quantum**. From IBM's quantum simulator. That was the state of quantum simulators in June 2018. If you're reading this post far in the future, all of this may change.
* **Conic sections**. The trajectory of a baseball thrown by a player and the path of a planet revolving around a star can both be described by the mathematics of conic sections.
* **RubyCaribe Logo**. An idea for a tech conference to be held in the Caribbean. Market realities kept me from launching this as early as I would have liked. You could say that I'm in the middle of a pivot on this one!
* **Warped space-time**. Graphical representation of space-time being warped by a massive, spherical object. Physicists theorize that what we perceive as gravity is actually the warping of space-time. The math supports the theory.
* **Unit Circle**. Graphical representation of Euler's identity, which can
be** proven with series expansion.
* **Apple**. Apple's logo is part of the machine.
* **Feynman Diagram**. Richard Feynman was a professor of physics at Caltech. He created these diagrams to graphically represent what happens when sub-atomic particles collide. Time runs from left to right, and the lines indicate whether energy is released or absorbed.
* **WindyCityDB**. WindyCityDB was a NoSQL database conference held by my team in Chicago.
* **H**. The favicon and app icon for the RayHightower.com site.
* **WindyCityThings**. WindyCityThings was an Internet of Things (IoT) conference held by my team in Chicago.
* **Maxwell's Equations**. Since light is a form of electromagnetic radiation, the reference to God's words from the book of Genesis is fitting. Tying them together in this way was an idea that I first saw on from a poster in a professor's office.
* **Eagle Scout Medal**. Some of my richest life experiences are connected to Scouting, including earning the rank of Eagle as a youth.
* **Prioritization Matrix**. This is from Stephen Covery's book, _The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People_. Quadrant 2 is highlighted because if we spend our time on things that are important (but not urgent) we will avoid running around on random tasks (quadrant 1) and we will achieve our goals, supported by the important tasks in the top half of the matrix.
* **Lipa Na M-Pesa**. Swahili for "Pay with M-Pesa". [M-Pesa](/blog/2016/12/29/m-pesa-blends-fintech-mobile-in-kenya/) is a mobile payment system that is integral to the economy in Kenya. M-Pesa has achieved higher penetration among mobile users within a country than any other mobile payment system in the world.
* **华强北真棒**. Chinese for "Huaqiangbei is awesome". [Huaqiangbei](/blog/2017/11/27/huaqiangbei-in-shenzhen-china/) is a region within the city of Shenzehen in China where electronics...
* **Alcubierre Drive**. Miguel Alcubierre is a professor of physics in Mexico City. He has theorized a way for ships to travel faster than light by warping space-time.
* **Blue 1647 Logo**. [Blue 1647]() is an amazing space in Chicago, IL, USA.
* **8th Light Logo**. [8th Light]() is a the software development company, based in Chicago, where I currently serve as director of the Los Angeles office.
* **Enso**. Shotokan Karate Dojo led by Sensei Jay Nacu, Sensei Denise Nacu, and Sensei Saul Notorio.
* **WindyCityRails**. The [Ruby on Rails]() conference that my team launched in Chicago in 2008.
* **WisdomGroup**. [WisdomGroup](http://wisdomgroup.com) is the technology company that I founded in 1994 and sold to 8th Light in 2016.

### Conclusion

Hopefully this post gives you enough information to engrave your own devices, if you choose to do so.
