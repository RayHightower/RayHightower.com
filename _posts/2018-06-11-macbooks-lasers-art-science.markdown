A few people have asked about the laser engraving on my MacBook. One person described the etchings as nerdy tattoos. Whatever you want to call them, this post outlines the engraving procedure that worked for me.

### Planning

Something you already know: Laser engraving is expensive and permanent. You only get one chance to get it right. Therefore, planning is essential.

### Why?

I’ve done the stickers-on-laptop thing for years. But with my latest machine, a 12” MacBook, it was time for something different: Laser engraving. 




Here’s a procedure that worked for me. Your mileage may vary.

Sure, you need the right equipment. CAS uses an [Epilog Laser](https://www.epiloglaser.com/) machine. But it goes beyond equipment. The engraving team needs to care deeply about alignment and attention to details.

Side note for my fellow software developers: That sounds a lot like craftsmanship to me.

Find an engraver that you trust. 
Serious track record.

Template URL. Rather than make my own. Found some good ones on Pinterest. Thisvone worked fir me (thanks @...). YMMV.

The engraver had done a dry run on acrylic before I arrived.

Recent life events. Things unlikely to change for 5 years. 

### Warranty

Does engraving void Apple’s warranty? I have no idea. But since I tend to engage in warranty-voiding activity on my electronic equipment anyway, this wasn’t a big factor for me.

### Choose an Engraver

How does one choose an engraver for an expensive piece of electronic equipment? I found several engravers on the web, and visited a few in person. In the end, I chose Chicago Award Source. 

Firoz, Christan, and Jenna did an outstanding job with my engraving. Christan and Jenna were meticulous with the laser machine, double- and triple-checking the alignment. They even did a practice run on scrap acrylic. It was clear that I had placed my trust in the right team.

Chicago Award Source handled my engraving very well. They handle laptops with special care.
