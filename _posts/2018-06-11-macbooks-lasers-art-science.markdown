A few people have asked about the laser engraved symbols on my MacBook. One person described the etchings as nerdy tattoos. Whatever you want to call them, if you would like to do something similar, here's the procedure that worked for me.

The end of the article gives a brief description for each symbol.

### Warranty

Does engraving void Apple’s warranty? I have no idea. The laser doesn't cut very deep, but if you're really concerned about warranty issues, you might want to speak with Apple.

### Planning

I spent two months choosing and placing the symbols. Laser engraving is expensive and permanent, so I wanted to get it right. Here's the chronolgy:

* Listing the symbols. I started by making a list of the symbols to be considered for inclusion. Evernote was great for keeping track of everything, because you can make notes anywhere and sync the info to all devices.
* Layout, first draft: Paper and pencil. Just to get a feel for the layout.
* Layout, intermediate drafts: Back to Evernote. I divided the surface
of the MacBook into four quadrants, and I gathered the symbols into groups that make sense to me.
* Layout, laser-ready. I chose [Affinity Designer]() because it can generate files in a variety of vector formats (.ai, .eps, .tiff) and I knew I would need an ultra-smooth vector file for the engraver. Unless you already own Adobe Illustrator, Affinity Designer is an inexpensive and effective way to go.

### Choosing an Engraver

How does one choose an engraver for an expensive piece of electronic equipment? I found several engravers on the web, and visited a few in person. In the end, I chose Chicago Award Source. 

Firoz, Christan, and Jenna did an outstanding job with my engraving. Christan and Jenna were meticulous with the laser machine, double- and triple-checking the alignment. They even did a practice run on scrap acrylic. It was clear that I had placed my trust in the right team.

Chicago Award Source handled my engraving very well. They handle laptops with special care.
### Why?

I’ve done the stickers-on-laptop thing for years. But with my latest machine, a 12” MacBook, it was time for something different: Laser engraving. 




Here’s a procedure that worked for me. Your mileage may vary.

Sure, you need the right equipment. CAS uses an [Epilog Laser](https://www.epiloglaser.com/) machine. But it goes beyond equipment. The engraving team needs to care deeply about alignment and attention to details.

Side note for my fellow software developers: That sounds a lot like craftsmanship to me.

Find an engraver that you trust. 
Serious track record.
