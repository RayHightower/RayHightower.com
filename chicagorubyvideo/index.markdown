ChicagoRuby posts [meeting videos every month](https://chicagoruby.org/videos/). Here's how. If you have ideas for improvement, feel free to use the [contact form](/contact).

### Tools Required

* iPod Touch. We use an old model (5) that we bought from the refurbished section of the Apple Store.

* Smartphone camera mount. Can be purchased at Amazon for less than $10.

* Tripod. Almost any model with a standard mount will do.


### Procedure

#. Make sure that the previous month's videos have been deleted from the camera. Yes, we have run out of space before, and it's not fun!

#. Setup the camera with the tripod and shoot the video.

#. After the shoot, and as soon as possible, make a backup of the video on your laptop.

#. Give the iPod Touch to the person at 8th Light who will be responsible for video editing and upload.

### For the Video Editor

#. Attach the iPod Touch to your laptop using a USB cable.

#. The iPod Touch might ask if you trust the computer. Choose `yes`.

### Video Editing

We don't do fancy editing with the monthly videos. To save time, we just trim the intro and the outro.

### Video Upload

#. Upload the video to the ChicagoRuby account at our video service, currently [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

#. Congratulations... you're done!
