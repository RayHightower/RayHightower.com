_by Rudyard Kipling_

If you can keep your head when all about you<br />
&#160;&#160;Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br />
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br />
&#160;&#160;But make allowance for their doubting too;<br />
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br />
&#160;&#160;Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,<br />
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,<br />
&#160;&#160;And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:<br />
<br />
If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;<br />
&#160;&#160;If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;<br />
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br />
&#160;&#160;And treat those two impostors just the same;<br />
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken<br />
&#160;&#160;Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br />
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br />
&#160;&#160;And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:<br />
<br />
If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br />
&#160;&#160;And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br />
And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br />
&#160;&#160;And never breathe a word about your loss;<br />
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br />
&#160;&#160;To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br />
And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br />
&#160;&#160;Except the Will which says to them: “Hold on!”<br />
<br />
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br />
&#160;&#160;Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,<br />
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br />
&#160;&#160;If all men count with you, but none too much;<br />
If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br />
&#160;&#160;With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,<br />
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,<br />
&#160;&#160;And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son.<br/>
&#160;&#160;And—which is more—you’ll be a Woman, my daughter.<br/>

_Note: My parents required my brother and me to memorize and recite this poem when we were seven or eight years old. I hated it! But the parental units were right. The final line, referencing women and daughters, was added by my parents in the 1970s._
