_by Edgar Albert Guest_

Somebody said that it couldn’t be done<br />
&#160;&#160;But he with a chuckle replied<br />
That “maybe it couldn’t,” but he would be one<br />
&#160;&#160;Who wouldn’t say so till he’d tried.<br />
So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin<br />
&#160;&#160;On his face. If he worried he hid it.<br />
He started to sing as he tackled the thing<br />
&#160;&#160;That couldn’t be done, and he did it!<br />

Somebody scoffed: “Oh, you’ll never do that;<br />
&#160;&#160;At least no one ever has done it;”<br />
But he took off his coat and he took off his hat<br />
&#160;&#160;And the first thing we knew he’d begun it.<br />
With a lift of his chin and a bit of a grin,<br />
&#160;&#160;Without any doubting or quiddit,<br />
He started to sing as he tackled the thing<br />
&#160;&#160;That couldn’t be done, and he did it.<br />

There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done,<br />
&#160;&#160;There are thousands to prophesy failure,<br />
There are thousands to point out to you one by one,<br />
&#160;&#160;The dangers that wait to assail you.<br />
But just buckle in with a bit of a grin,<br />
&#160;&#160;Just take off your coat and go to it;<br />
Just start in to sing as you tackle the thing<br />
&#160;&#160;That “cannot be done,” and you’ll do it.<br />

_Note: My parents required my brother and me to memorize and recite poetry from a very young age. I hated it! But the parental units were right. We were also required to memorize the poem <a href="/if-rudyard-kipling/">If by Rudyard Kipling</a>._
